Here's a guide to the key linear algebra concepts youâ€™ll need for machine learning. This will give you a refresher with an emphasis on practical use cases relevant to data science.

### Linear Algebra Concepts for Machine Learning

#### 1. **Vectors and Vector Operations**

- **Definition of a Vector**: Data as vectors, representing points in multi-dimensional space.
- **Vector Addition and Scalar Multiplication**: Basics of manipulating vectors.
- **Norms**: Magnitude of vectors, including the L1 and L2 norms (used in regularization).
- **Dot Product**: Essential for projections and angle measurements between vectors.
- **Cross Product**: Relevant in 3D spaces but less common in typical machine learning tasks.


#### 2. **Matrices and Matrix Operations**

- **Matrix Definition and Notation**: Understanding rows, columns, and types of matrices (square, rectangular, etc.).
- **Matrix Addition and Scalar Multiplication**: Extending vector operations to matrices.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: How to combine data transformations or operations.
- **Transpose of a Matrix**: Used in various algorithms like PCA and least-squares regression.

#### 3. **Matrix Inverses and Determinants**

- **Matrix Inversion**: How to solve linear systems (e.g., linear regression) and understanding singular matrices.
- **Determinant**: Its significance in matrix invertibility and the geometry of transformations.
- **Pseudo-Inverse**: Important for handling non-invertible matrices, especially in least-squares solutions.

#### 4. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**

- **Definition**: Key to understanding dimensionality reduction and covariance matrices.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: How eigenvectors and eigenvalues are used in reducing dimensions and extracting features.

#### 5. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**

- **Definition**: Factorization of a matrix, which is used in tasks like dimensionality reduction, noise reduction, and matrix approximation.
- **Connection to PCA**: SVD can be used to compute the principal components.

#### 6. **Orthogonality and Orthonormality**

- **Orthogonal Vectors and Matrices**: Importance in machine learning algorithms for ensuring no overlap between components (e.g., in PCA).
- **Gram-Schmidt Process**: Method for orthonormalizing a set of vectors, used in various algorithms.

#### 7. **Projections**

- **Projection onto Subspaces**: Key for least-squares regression and understanding hyperplanes in higher-dimensional spaces.
- **Orthogonal Projections**: Used in regression, PCA, and more.

#### 8. **Linear Transformations**

- **Definition**: How matrices can be seen as linear transformations applied to data vectors.
- **Interpretation of Matrix Multiplication as a Transformation**: E.g., rotation, scaling, and shearing.
- **Rank**: The rank of a matrix helps you understand the dimensionality of the data after a transformation.

#### 9. **Vector Spaces**

- **Basis and Span**: Understanding the dimension of data space and how to work with reduced dimensions.
- **Linear Independence**: Why it's crucial to avoid redundant features or transformations.

#### 10. **Systems of Linear Equations**

- **Solving Linear Systems**: Essential in optimization tasks and linear models.
- **Row Reduction and Gaussian Elimination**: Helps in solving systems and finding matrix inverses.

#### 11. **Positive Definite Matrices**

- **Definition**: Important in optimization, especially for convex functions and ensuring minimums in certain algorithms like gradient descent.

#### 12. **Norms and Condition Numbers**

- **Matrix Norms**: Important in measuring the size of a matrix (or its effect on vectors).
- **Condition Number**: Helps in understanding the sensitivity of a system to changes in input.

#### 13. **Tensor Operations**

- **Tensors and Tensor Algebra**: Useful for deep learning when handling multi-dimensional data.
- **Tensor Decomposition**: Analogous to SVD for higher-order matrices.
