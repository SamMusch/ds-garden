[MLflow | Intro](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/introduction/index.html)
- [Image | Workflow and Personas](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/_images/mlflow-overview.png)

MLflow provides a **unified platform** to navigate the intricate maze of **model development**, **deployment**, and **management**.

- [[MLflow - Tracking]]: Tracks parameters, code versions, metrics, and artifacts.
- [[MLflow - Registry]]: Handles model versions, discerns their current state, ensures smooth productionization.
- [[MLflow - Deployment for LLMs]]: Server/interface to access SaaS & OSS LLM models. Offers a common set of APIs for prominent LLMs.
- [[MLflow - Evaluate]]: Set of tools for model comparison, be it traditional ML algorithms or LLMs.
- [[MLflow - Prompt Engineering UI]]: Provides a space for prompt experimentation, refinement, evaluation, testing, and deployment.
- [[MLflow - Recipes]]: Guide for structuring ML projects. Offers recs and helps ensure model is optimized for deployment.
- [[MLflow - Projects]]: Standardize the packaging of code, workflows, and artifacts, akin to an executable. Each project, be it a directory with code or a Git repository, employs a descriptor or convention to define its dependencies and execution method.
