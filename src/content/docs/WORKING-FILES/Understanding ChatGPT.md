Understanding ChatGPT through Aristotle's 4 causes
```

### 1. Material

> _"What is the substrate or substance out of which it is composed?"_
- **Architecture lineage:** GPT-4 vs GPT-3 vs GPT-2 (Transformer anatomy)
- **Tokenization & embeddings:** Byte pair encoding (BPE), positional embeddings
- **Training data:** Nature, scale, domain skew, multilinguality
- **Numerical computation:** Floating-point precision, matrix ops, hardware stack (TPUs, GPUs)
- **Memory & statelessness:** Why context is bounded and ephemeral
- **Pretraining corpus vs fine-tuning datasets:** Web text, RLHF traces, feedback loops

### 2. Formal

> _"What is its form, structure, or governing pattern?"_
- **Transformers:** Self-attention, multi-head mechanisms, feedforward layers
- **Causal language modeling:** Next-token prediction, autoregressive flow
- **Optimization strategy:** AdamW, learning rate schedules, gradient clipping
- **Loss functions:** Cross-entropy over tokens, KL-divergence in RLHF
- **Fine-tuning & alignment:** Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modeling
- **Prompt conditioning:** How prompts enter the computation graph

### 3. Efficient

> _"Who or what brings it into operation?"_
- **Inference pipeline:** From prompt to token stream (sampling strategies, logit processing, beam search vs nucleus sampling)
- **System prompt and hidden prompt engineering**
- **Temperature, top-k, top-p:** How generation is controlled probabilistically
- **Latency & throughput constraints:** Effects of batch size, parallelism, quantization
- **Fine-tuning vs adapters vs RAG:** Deployment-time augmentations
- **Custom instructions, memory, agents:** User-level extensions

### 4. Final

> _"What is the purpose or end it is directed toward?"_
- Dialogue systems, copilots, knowledge synthesis, reasoning augmentation
- Embedding generation for downstream tasks
- Tool-augmented reasoning (e.g. plug-ins, code interpreters, vector search)

### ðŸ§­ Meta Category: **Ontology of Interaction**
(Formal x Final)

> _"How should humans organize knowledge to interface with ChatGPT most effectively?"_
- **Input representations:** Tables, trees, graphs, OWL ontologies
- **Chaining prompts:** (break down complex systems into..)
    - *Modular design*: Components called modules
    - *Functional decomposition*: break down a complex system into smaller parts (functions)
- **Knowledge alignment:** How structured knowledge (e.g. taxonomies) helps or hinders token prediction
- **Epistemic boundaries:** When ChatGPT generalizes well vs when it hallucinates
