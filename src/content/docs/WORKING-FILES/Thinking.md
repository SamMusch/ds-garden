Should create notes using this top-down approach in the future. Never know where I'll end up. Reminds me of the session_start.

Why “Families”? (Epistemological Rationale)
Using _“family”_ helps in categorizing and reasoning about complex phenomena. It’s a way of managing abstraction and variability.
- In **statistics**, a "family of distributions" (e.g. exponential family, Gaussian family) refers to a set of probability distributions that share a common form or property, often parameterized in a certain way.
- In **logic or cognitive frameworks**, "families of structures" might mean conceptual models that share inferential logic or internal coherence but differ in specifics.





### Explanatory Structures

**Meta-communication**: how we structure ideas for understanding.
These can be grouped into broader **families of structures** based on their function or logic.

| **Family**                 | Layman                  | **Primary Goal**           | **Structures Inside**                                    |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Descriptive**            | What is it?             | Clarify or define          | Definition, taxonomy, parts/whole                        |
| **Analytical**             | How is it similar/diff? | Distinguish, assess        | Comparison, critique, evaluation frameworks              |
| **Causal / Logical**       | How does it work?       | Explain why/how            | Cause-effects, logical sequences, *ontological cascades* |
| **Procedural**             | How do I do it?         | Guide action               | Steps, checklists, workflows                             |
| **Historical / Narrative** | How did it evolve?      | Show development or origin | Timelines, evolution, paradigm shifts                    |



**Hybrid Structures**: Mixing these families together.
Examples:
- A **comparison table** followed by a **logic chain**
- A **definition + application + critique** trio
- A **taxonomy** with embedded **procedures** under each category


### Research

**Research Paradigm Framework**: A **hierarchical framework** for understanding and conducting research (especially in the social sciences, philosophy of science, and empirical inquiry).
1. Ontology | *What exists?*
2. Epistemology | *How can we know what exists?*
3. Methodology | *How do we investigate reality and knowledge?*
4. Methods | *What tools do we use to investigate?*


Common research paradigms that use this framework:

| Paradigm            | Ontology                | Epistemology            | Methodology             | Methods                    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Positivism**      | Objective reality       | Empirical, measurable   | Experimental, deductive | Surveys, statistics, tests |
| **Interpretivism**  | Socially constructed    | Subjective, contextual  | Inductive, qualitative  | Interviews, observations   |
| **Critical theory** | Reality shaped by power | Emancipatory, reflexive | Transformative          | Action research, discourse |

#### Research details (Ontology, Epistemology, Methodology, Methods)
**1. Ontology** – *What exists?*
* **Definition**: The study of being or reality. It deals with what kinds of things actually exist in the world.
* **Research context**: Asks questions like, *What is the nature of reality?* Is there an objective reality independent of us (realism), or is reality constructed by human perception or social processes (constructivism)?
* **Why it matters**: Your assumptions about what exists shape everything else down the chain.

**2. Epistemology** – *How can we know what exists?*
* **Definition**: The theory of knowledge. It concerns how we come to know things and what counts as valid knowledge.
* **Research context**: Asks, *How do we know what we know?* Do we gain knowledge through objective observation (positivism) or subjective interpretation (interpretivism)?
* **Link to ontology**: Your view on reality affects how you think knowledge about that reality can be obtained.

**3. Methodology** – *How do we investigate reality and knowledge?*
* **Definition**: The overall strategy or design behind a research project—your logic of inquiry.
* **Research context**: Should your approach be experimental, case-based, ethnographic, etc.? Should it be qualitative, quantitative, or mixed?
* **Link to epistemology**: Your beliefs about what counts as knowledge guide the selection of your research design.

**4. Methods** – *What tools do we use to investigate?*
* **Definition**: The specific techniques or procedures you use to collect and analyze data.
* **Examples**: Surveys, interviews, statistical modeling, content analysis, etc.
* **Link to methodology**: Your methodology dictates what methods are appropriate.
