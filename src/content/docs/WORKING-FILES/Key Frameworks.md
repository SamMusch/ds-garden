I don't know if "frameworks" is the right word.

Put these on the wall.



Add definitions when hovering over word

Want Astro to reflect the functionality of Obsidian

Learn more about Aristotle's "efficient" cause.

I think I'm looking for a "framework of everything". 
- The basic building blocks / logic that make up this framework
- The resulting framework that can capture everything else.


(I'm guessing Aristotle differentiates 1-3 v 4. Make sure.)
Top-down vs bottom-up
- Top-down summary: What's the final cause? 
- Bottum-up building blocks: The other 3. How do we arrive to the final cause?


I think the proper way to structure python projects is:
- a main script containing custom functions
- each custom script
Is it different for web devs?
Seems the same as MOCs

Naming conventions for PKMS - same as python? Notes as verbs?

*The Axiomatic Method - is this the foundation for everything else?*

Aristotle's 4 causes
- Material
- Formal
- Efficient
- Final
```


```ad-sam
Ontologies - 3 building blocks
- **Axioms**: Basic "truth" statements
- **Entities** are the names that appear in those statements:
    - _Individuals_ (objects)
    - _Classes_ (categories)
    - _Properties_ (relations/attributes)
- **Expressions** are compound phrases you build from entities.

Explanatory Structures
**Meta-communication**: how we structure ideas for understanding.
These can be grouped into broader **families of structures** based on their function or logic.

| **Family**                 | Layman                  | **Primary Goal**           | **Structures Inside**                                    |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Descriptive**            | What is it?             | Clarify or define          | Definition, taxonomy, parts/whole                        |
| **Analytical**             | How is it similar/diff? | Distinguish, assess        | Comparison, critique, evaluation frameworks              |
| **Causal / Logical**       | How does it work?       | Explain why/how            | Cause-effects, logical sequences, *ontological cascades* |
| **Procedural**             | How do I do it?         | Guide action               | Steps, checklists, workflows                             |
| **Historical / Narrative** | How did it evolve?      | Show development or origin | Timelines, evolution, paradigm shifts                    |
