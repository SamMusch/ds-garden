### AXIOMS

**Andrew Misseldine**
1.2 Axiomatic Systems and Their Properties
The study of modern geometry often begins with the axiomatic method, which separates it from the ancient approach.

The Axiomatic Method
1. *Undefined terms* | An axiomatic system includes a set of **undefined** technical terms subject to interpretation.
2. *Definitions* | All other technical terms are defined using the **undefined** terms.
3. *Axioms* | The system includes a set of unproved statements involving undefined terms and definitions — the axioms.
4. *Theorems* | All other statements must be logical consequences of the axioms — theorems.

Axioms are taken on faith because, without base truths (axioms), proof becomes circular or infinite.
