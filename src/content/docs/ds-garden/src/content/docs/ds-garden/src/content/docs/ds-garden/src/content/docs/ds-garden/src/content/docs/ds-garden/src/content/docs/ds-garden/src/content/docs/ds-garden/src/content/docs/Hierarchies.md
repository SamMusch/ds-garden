### Hierarchy
```plaintext
Paradigm
└─ Objective
   └─ Task
      └─ Class
         └─ Methodology
            └─ Framework
               └─ Technique / Method
                  └─ Algorithm
                     └─ Architecture / Topology
                        └─ Model
                           └─ Checkpoint
