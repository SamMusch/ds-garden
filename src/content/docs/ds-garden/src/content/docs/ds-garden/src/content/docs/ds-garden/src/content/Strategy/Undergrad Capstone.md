### 1. Intro

**Strategy**: Gain & sustain competitive advantage
- Plan to solve / respond to problem
- Requires trade offs for strategic positioning
- Only have 2-3 main points of focus

**Kernel of strategy**
- **Diagnosis**: What are we actually solving? How important is it?
- **Guiding policy**: Solution to the diagnosis + flow from diagnosis
- **Coherent Action**: Who does what? Where? When? Low level details


**AFI Framework**: 3 key elements of strategy

1. **Diagnosis**: What is the competitive landscape?
- External analysis (industry structure, competitive forces, strategic groups)
- Internal analysis (resources, capabilities, core competencies)
- Competitive advantage, firm performance, business model

2. **Guiding policy**: Guiding idea to address competitive challenge
- Business strategy (differentiation, cost leadership, integration, innovation and entrepreneurship)
- Corporate strategy (vertical integration, diversification, mergers, strategic alliances)
- Global strategy (competing around the world)

3. **Coherent Action**: Strategy implementation (Actions to implement idea)
- Organizational design (structure, culture, control)
- Corporate governance & business ethics

**Effects on firm performance**
- 55% our effects
- 20% industry as a whole effects
- 25% other effects (business cycle, unexplained variance)

**Stakeholders: Superior performance drives reinvestments**
- External: customers, media, suppliers
- Internal: employees, stockholders, board members

How good stakeholder management helps: Cooperation, trust means lower transaction costs, greater adaptable, strong reputation

**Stakeholders impact analysis:** recognize, assess, and address needs of stakeholders, helps achieve competitive advantage
1. Who are the stakeholders?
2. What are their interests?
3. What opps / threats do they pose?
4. What responsibilities do we have to them?
5. How to address their concerns?

Need positive relationships to survive **Black Swan** (unanticipated) events.

### 2. External
#### PESTEL
Political, economic, sociocultural, tech, ecological, legal
- What's most important for our company?
- What really moves the needle + how it will make a difference?

1. Political
   Govt influence (eg Subsidies, investment in R&D)
   Political pressure (eg Drug prices, loan rates)

2. Legal
   Antitrust regulations, environment, hiring laws, SOX
3. Economic variables
   Int rates, employment levels, inflation, disposable income

4. Sociocultural
   Lifestyle, society values, family size, ethnicity

5. Technology
   Capturing application of knowledge

6. Ecological
   Natural environment, global warming


#### Industry Structure

Industry Analysis identifies the industry's profit potential.

Competitive Advantage = a large value gap (V - C)
- V = how much people want it
- C = cost

Attractive industry: high competitive advantage easy (profit potential & weaker 5 forces)



#### 5 forces

How profitable firms COULD be, but actual success depends on minimizing weaknesses & taking advantage of strengths.

Structure of the industry based on:
- Number & size of competitors
- Pricing power
- Products offered
- Barriers of entry


**(1) Threat new entrants**
Barriers to entry
Customer switching costs
Capital requirements
Incumbents (established brand, prop tech, distribution channels)

**(2) Bargaining power of buyers**
Pricing power
Strong supplier power when:
	Supplier industry concentrated
	Don't depend much on current customers, switching costs high
	Limited substitutes

**(3) Bargaining power of suppliers**
Pricing power
Strong buyer power when:
	Few large buyer
	Standard products
	Few switching costs
	No asymmetric info

**(4) Threat of substitutes**
Attractive price-performance trade-off
When lower price impact MB greater than lower quality MC
Buyers switching costs low, limits price we can charge

**(5) Incumbent rivalries**
Think perfect competition
High exit barriers, direct substitutes

#### Competitor Analysis

**Strategic Groups:** why performance can differ greatly within industry
- Firms with same strategic group = same strategy (Delta & United)
- Group differences id different strategies (Delta vs regional)
- Direct competitors = firms in our group (Delta, United)
- Rivalry within (Delta vs United) is greater than outside rivalry (huge airline vs regional)

**Mobility barriers:** Restrict movement between groups



### 3. Internal

**Core competency** --> competitive advantage --> differentiation or cost leader
- **Resources**: Business's assets
  - Tangible: Capital and labor
  - Intangible: Culture, reputation, IP
- **Capabilities**: Ability to exploit its resources
- **Competency**: Integration and coordination of capabilities



#### VIRO

Objective is to sustain competitive advantage.

Valuable
Rare
Costly to imitate
Organized to capture value of resources

Done at the **resource** level, not the company level.

Assumptions:
- Hetero resources across the industry
- Sticky resources from firm to firm





**AirAsia Case Notes**

**(1) Problem formulation:**

- Diagnosis: What are we actually solving and how important is it?
- Diagnosis: How does AirAsia maintain their competitive advantage through their cost leadership strategy without impacting their image in an industry that is typically viewed as having razor thin margins?

**(2) Analytical frameworks: VRIO**

- Achieving sustainable competitive advantage (Internal analysis)
- Differentiation or cost leadership comes from competitive advantage, which in turn comes from core competencies.
- Airasia’s CC = much lower long run average expenses compared to the industry
- Competitive advantage = able to profitably offer lower prices to customers (cost leadership strategy)

**VRIO Overview (Done at resource level, not company level)**

- **Valuable**: Are the features attractive, do they provide lower costs?
- **Rare**: Is this capability / resource only possessed by a few firms?
- **Costly to imitate**: Hard for other firms to develop this resource / capability at a reasonable price?
- **Organized to capture value of resources**: can it help exploit competitive potential?

**VRIO Example**

- **Resource / Capability**: Utilization of staff
- **Valuable**: Yes - lower average costs when people can perform multiple tasks
- **Rare**: Yes - typical for firms to have employees specialize
- **Costly to imitate**: Yes - requires additional up-front training
- **Organized to capture value of resources**: Yes - huge part of maintaining competitive advantage through cost leadership



### 4. Strategy

Strategy (Differentiation, Cost Leader, Integrate)

**Determining Strategy** (**Economic value added = Value — Cost**)
1. Who buys our stuff?
2. Why do they want it?
   Cost leader
   Product differentiation
3. How do we get it to them?



**Value Drivers**

(1) **Differentiation**: Minimized substitution, many are tough to imitate
- Product: quality, convenient, unique etc
- Customer service
- Complements: extra stuff along with product

(2) **Cost leader**: Invest in resources that drive down costs in the long run
- Input factors
- Economies of scale
- Learning curve effect
- Experience curve effect

(3) **Integration**: best of both worlds, very difficult to achieve
- Technology and innovation: better quality but lower cost
- Economies of scope
- Structure & culture


**Cost Drivers**: Economies of scale, all of these "hurt" at first, then help down the line
- Learning curves pushed down, then
- Process innovation pushes down, then
- Experience curve pushes down
