### Business Analogy
```ad-sam
- **PyTorch**: kitchen that lets chefs experiment with recipes, then creates ready-to-serve meals. 
- **JAX**: a factory line that automates recipe execution at scale
```

### High-Level Concept
Modern ML frameworks combine ease of use with performance optimizations. 
- PyTorch 2.x emphasizes flexible, Python‑style development with optional compilation for speed. 
- JAX offers a functional approach, automatically parallelizing and optimizing computations.

### Connections to Other Topics
- **Quantization and Deployment**: Framework compilation features simplify converting models to lighter formats for edge devices.  
- **MLOps Pipelines**: Integrates seamlessly with CI/CD workflows by scripting model definitions as pure functions.  
- **Hardware Awareness**: Both frameworks adapt to different accelerators—GPUs, TPUs, and even mobile chips—enabling on‑device AI.




## Details
### PyTorch
- **torch.compile**  
  Compiles eager models into optimized kernels via TorchInductor and AOTAutograd.
- **Dynamic Eager Execution**  
  Allows Python-native debugging and control flow, with optional compilation.
- **TorchScript Hybridization**  
  Export parts of the model to an intermediate representation for deployment.

### JAX
- **Functional NumPy API**  
  Drop-in replacement for NumPy with `jit`, `grad`, `vmap`, `pmap`.
- **XLA Compilation**  
  Just-In-Time-compiles code for CPU, GPU, and TPU targets.
- **Purely Functional Paradigm**  
  Emphasizes immutability and function transformations.

### Feature Comparison
| Feature            | PyTorch 2.x             | JAX                       |
|--------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Compilation        | `torch.compile`         | `jax.jit` & XLA           |
| Autograd           | Eager Autograd Engine   | Functional `grad` API     |
| Vectorization      | Manual/`torch.vmap`     | Automatic `vmap`          |
| Parallelism        | `DistributedDataParallel` | `pmap`                    |

### Quick Start Examples
```python
# PyTorch 2.x compilation
import torch
model = torch.nn.Linear(10, 5)
compiled_model = torch.compile(model)
```

```python
# JAX jit and grad
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

def loss_fn(x):
    return jnp.sum(x ** 2)

jit_loss = jax.jit(loss_fn)
grad_loss = jax.grad(loss_fn)
```
