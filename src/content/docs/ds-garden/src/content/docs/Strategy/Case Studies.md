[Chat - GA4 and Hubspot](https://chatgpt.com/share/6726643b-f31c-8000-b4a6-388591425b54)


**Situation**: As a marketing agency, we need to attract new clients in order to maximize profit. An important piece of attracting new clients is establishing ourselves as experts in the markets we compete in. One way we do this is by hosting a podcast. Separate strategic decisions have led us into the F&B space. As a result, we're creating episodes in this podcast dedicated to F&B specifically.

**Complication**: Its not possible to directly measure the real-world impact that these episodes have on our target audience. Instead, we need to rely on indirect metrics from our website (GA4) and sources of this traffic (paid Linkedin, organic Linkedin posts, SEM).

**Key Question**: How can we assess the effectiveness of our F&B-focused podcast episodes in establishing our agency as a market expert and attracting new clients, using indirect metrics from GA4, SEM and LinkedIn?


Questions:
- Compared to other marketing efforts, has the podcast series been any good?
- Compared to other episodes, has BOH been any good?
	- Social paid
	- Social organic
	- SEM
	- GA4
