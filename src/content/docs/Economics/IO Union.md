## Ch 2

What drives firm behavior?

- Customers (Demand)
  - Exogenous besides marketing
- Nature (Technology)
- Competitors

Short vs Long Run

- Short: Capital is fixed, labor is variable
- Long: Both are variable

---

### 2.2 Consumer Theory and Demand

#### Model

$Individual \: utility = U\underbrace{(q1,\:\:q2,\:\:}_{\text{Goods}}\overbrace{t, \:\:\: m)}^{\text{Tastes \: and \: income}}$

Demand

- $q1, q2$: Available goods ($Q = q_1 + q_2$)
- $t$: Tastes, preferences
- $m$: Income, budget constraints

Law of demand: Negative relationship between P & Q, slope determined by substitution and income effects

Demand:$q_1(p_1) = \frac{a-p_1}{b}$

- $a$: Price intercept
- $b$: Slope

Demand shifters:

1. p2: Price of other goods
2. m: Income
3. t: Tastes

Price elasticity:

- % change in quantity demand divided by % change in price
- $\epsilon = \frac{\part Q}{\part p} * \frac{p}{Q}$
- If$\epsilon * -1 > 1$, then 1% change in price = 1% change in Q. This good is Elastic

#### Revenue

- $TR = p(Q) * Q$
- $MR = \frac{\part TR}{\part Q} = \frac{\part AR}{\part Q} * Q + AR$

---

### 2.3 Technology and Costs (Multiple Products)

- $W_{L} = Price\:of\:labor$
- $W_{K} = Price\:of\:capital$
- $q1 = Quantity\: of\: good\: 1$
- $q2 = Quantity\: of\: good\: 2$
- $T = Technology$

$Total\:Cost = TC\: (\underbrace{W_{L}, \: W_{K}},\underbrace{ \: q1, \: q2}, \: T)$

We will see **economies of scale** when the long run average cost falls as output increases.
As long as the average cost is less than the marginal cost, we should keep producing.
**Minimum efficient scale** - Mimimum quantity produced to take advantage of economies of scale.

$AC=\frac{100\quad-\quad\overbrace{20Q + Q^2}^{\text{Minimize this}} \qquad + \overbrace{40\alpha}^{\text{Parameter (Larger = flatter parabola)}}}{4\alpha}$

$MC =\frac{100-40Q + 3Q^2+40\alpha}{4\alpha}$

$At\:the\: quantity\: where\: AC \:is\: minimized,\: AC = MC.$

There is **economies of scope** if joint production by a single firm is cheaper than production by two seperate firms.
Why?
(1) Complements in production (using by-products of each other)
(2) Share common inputs (railroads transporting passengers and freight)

---

### 2.4 Theory of the Firm

"The goal of the firm is to maximize profits."

$Economic \: profits  \: =  \: total \: revenue\: - \: economic \: costs$

$Value \: of \: an \: asset \: = \: PV \: of \: the \:stream\: of \:its\: expected\: future\: returns$

Issue: Firms look to maximize in the long run, not just right now

Solution: Discounting

$\beta = Discount\: factor\: (PV \: of\: 1 \:dollar\: recieved\: next\: period,\: scale\: from\: 0 \:to\: 1)$
$\quad \beta = .9 \: represents \:  90 \: cents \: today \: equaling \: 1  \: dollar \: tomorrow$

$Value(\pi,\infty) = \beta^0 \pi + \beta^1 \pi + ... + \beta^n \pi$

$Value(\pi,\infty) = \frac{\pi}{1-\beta}$

---

Discounting Example

So, the PV of receiving 1 dollar every day when we value 90c today as 1 USD tomorrow is 10 dollars
D = .9
$\pi$= 1 dollar
$Value = \frac{\pi}{1-\beta} = \frac{1}{1-.9} = 10$

This helps us see how much profit we will be willing to give up today in exchange for additional profit in the future. A higher$\beta$implies that a greater value is placed on the future.

---

Another issue:

Principle-agent problem -  managers and employees look to maximize their own utility (income, prestige, other psychological factors)

---

2.4 Boundaries of the firm

**Why set up a firm?**
(1) Horizontal growth - provides greater economies of scale (merger in same industry)
(2) Conglomerate growth - provides greater economies of scope (merger in different industries)
(3) Reduces transaction costs (costs associated with trading)
(4) Vertical growth - buying up the supply chain

**Forces that limit size of firm:**
(1) Merger with a supplier reduces the suppliers flexibility and control -> market inefficiencies
(2) The supplier may be too large to be profitably owned by a single wholesaler
(3) Managerial capacity - costs grow as firm grows

**Costs can be broken down into 2 groups:**
(1) Those that decline as the org grows (eg transaction costs)
(2) Those that grow as the org grows (eg managerial costs)

$TC = C_{MGT} + C_{MKT}$

### 2.5 Questions

#### Problem 2

Question: What is the difference between the snob effect and the conspicuous effect?

**Answer**:

Both the snob & conspicuous effect fall under nonfunction demand due to interdependent utility functions.

The snob effect is when someone purchases items with low demand in order to be different from the crowd. "The demand curve with a snob effect will be less elastic than for the functional demand curve."

The conspicuous effect is where people purchase a good to impress others. The high price of this type of good adds to the prestige of the good. Because of this, the conspicuous effect could theoretically produce a positively-sloped demand curve.

---

#### Problem 4

Question: If income falls and demand for a good decreases, is the good normal, inferior, or income-neutral?

**Answer:**

If income falls and the demand for the good decreases, the good is normal.

---

#### Problem 6

Question: A firm sells two brands of a good (x and y).

They are considering raising the price of brand y.

The cross price elasticity is -.5.

---

a) Interpret the value of the cross-price elasticity

$Elasticity_{xy} = \frac{\partial  Q_{x}}{\partial p_{y}} * \frac{p_{y}}{Q_{x}} =\frac{\%\Delta Q_{x}}{\% \Delta P_{y}} = -.5 $

**Answer:**

For every 1% decrease in price of good "y", there was a resulting .5% increase in quantity demanded of good "x".

---

b) Are the two brands substitues, complements, or unrelated?

**Answer:**

Cross-price elasticity is positive for substitute goods, negative for complements, and zero for unrelated goods. Our value is negative, so "x" and "y" are complements.

---

#### Problem 7

Question: Consider a market with the following demand function:

$P = a - 2bQ \: \:$ where a and b are positive constants

---

##### a) Write down TR and MR

**Answer:**

Total Revenue: $$ TR = P(Q)\: \: *Q $$

Total Revenue: $$ TR = (a - 2bQ) \: \: *Q $$

Marginal Revenue: $$ MR = P'(Q) * Q + P(Q) $$

Marginal Revenue: $$ MR = (-2bQ) + (a - 2bQ) $$

Marginal Revenue: $$ MR = -4bQ + a $$

---

##### b) Graph the demand curve and the MR curve

**Answer:**

![IMG_0316.PNG](attachment:IMG_0316.PNG)

---

c) What is MR when price elasticity of demand = 1?

**Answer:**

If elasticity of demand = 1, then MR = 0.

$\varepsilon = \frac{p}{p-MR} $

---

$\varepsilon = 1$ $\quad$ $->$ $\quad$ $1 = \frac{p}{p-MR}$ $\quad$  $->$  $\quad$ $0 = MR $

$\varepsilon = 2$ $\quad$ $->$ $\quad$ $1 = \frac{p}{p-MR}$ $\quad$  $->$  $\quad$ $.5P = MR $

$\varepsilon = 3$ $\quad$ $->$ $\quad$ $1 = \frac{p}{p-MR}$ $\quad$  $->$  $\quad$ $.66P = MR $

---

d) What is the maximum TR? What is the price elasticity of demand at this maximized TR?

**Answer:**

We will find maximum TR where MR = 0.

$ MR = -4bQ + a $

$ 0 = -4bQ + a $

$ 4bQ = a $

$ Q = \frac{a}{4b} $ $\quad$ TR maximized when $Quantity = \frac{Y\:intercept}{slope}$

**This is the point where MR = 0, so the price elasticity of demand = 1.**

| 3    | -          | 153.3        | 139.9         |

**Answer:**

| Q    | Total cost | Average cost | Marginal cost |
| ---- | ---------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 0    | 70         | -            | -             |

#### Problem 10

Question: A technological change improves the efficiency of the production of a good.

How do you expect this will impact a firm's long run average and marginal costs?

**Answer:**

The firm will see a decrease in average costs due to improvements in efficiency. They will be able to produce the same amount of units, but with fewer inputs (capital and labor).

Marginal costs will also fall as it becomes cheaper to produce one more unit. The firm will be able to take advantage of economies of scale further will reach their minimum efficient scale (MES) at a larger quantity.

#### Problem 12

Question: Every day, a clothing design firm needs workers who sew. It could (a) Contract out these services or (b) Keep them in-house.

Compare the relative firm vs market costs for this problem for

Firm a) Sell low-cost dresses

Firm b) Sell high-cost, designer dresses

Which firm is more likely to contract out and which is more likely to keep in-house?

**Answer:**

The firm who sells low cost dresses would be more likely to contract our their sewing. This is because the design firm won't have the same economies of scale to continue to produce dresses.

The firm who sells high cost designer dresses, on the other hand, would be more likely to keep their sewing in house. The quantity demanded will be relatively small compared to the design firm who sells low cost dresses. These dresses will be more customized as well so it will be cheaper / easier to do the work in-house.

- (c) Veblen / conspicuous consumption effect - purchase to impress, expensive
  (2) Speculative - purchase as an investment
  (3) Irrational - purchase on a whim

## Ch 3: Game Theory

**3.1 Describing a game**
**3.2 Static + complete**
**3.3 Dynamic + complete + perfect info**
**3.4 Repeated games**
**3.5 Bargaining + fair allocations**
**3.6 Games with incomplete + assymetric + imperfect info**

**Nash Equilibrium** | No advantage in switching for either side

**Game theory** is the study of
rational behavior
in strategic settings
where players make flawless calculations
in determining the actions
that best serve their interests

**General Information**

- **Strategic game** (Not pure luck/skill) Actions of 1 player influences actions of another
- **Noncooperative game theory** | No contracts / cooperation allowed (eg US business environment)

**Rules of game theory**

1. Never play a dominated strategy
2. If you have a dominant strategy, play it
3. Eliminate strategies until all dominated are eliminated
4. If dominant & iterated dominant don't exist, look for mutual best replies
5. (Dynamic games): Look forward, reason backwards

All games have a mixed-strategy (probability of choosing). Sometimes it just so happens the probability is 100% (pure strategy).

---

### 3.1 Describing a Game

**Underlying assumption** is that players are rational

1. You are aware of your preferences & constraints
2. You act consistently given your preferences & constraints & behavior of others

#### Game theory characteristics

1) **Strategy** | players contingency plan or decision rule (optimal action in every possible scenario)

2) **Timing** of play
   $\quad$ (a) Static game = each player moves without knowing their opponents move
   $\quad$ (b) Dynamic game = order of play is sequential

3) **Information Set** | Info each player has at each stage of the game
   $\quad$ (a) Complete information = each player knows the payoff / objective of every other player
   $\quad$ (b) Perfect information (dynamic games only) = each player knows the history of the other players in the game
   $\quad$ (c) Common knowledge = Information known by everyone in the game, everyone knows everyone else knows
   $\quad$ (d) Symmetric information = each player has the same set of information

**Rules of the game**
(1) Players
(2) Actions
(3) Timing of play
(4) Payoff function of each player
(5) Information available

### 3.2 Static Games + Complete Information

Everyone moves without knowing the others player's moves.
Everyone knows the other players' objectives.

#### 1) Coordination games

Players benefit from cooperating.
Communication before playing the game helps with the final outcome.

**Example 1: Driving on one side of the road**
It doesn't matter whether people choose left or right as long as they make the same choice.

**Example 2: Pareto Coordination Game**
There is one outcome that would be best for everyone, but another where they will benefit more than the rest of the options.
Both choosing the one correct box $\:$$\:$  >$\:$ $\:$  both choosing a different box $\:$ $\:$  > $\:$ $\:$ choosing different boxes

**Example 3: Dating game**
Guy likes meat + red wine
Girl likes fish + white win

Guy brings fish to make girl happy
Girl brings red wine to make guy happy
Dinner = ruined

#### 2) Competitive games

**Example 1: Zero sum games (Matching pennies)**

**Example 2: Not zero sum (War - each side wants the other to be peaceful.)**
From the perspective of A:
Best result = They are peaceful, we attack (+3)
2nd best result = We are both peaceful (+2)
3rd best result = They attack, we are peaceful but limited damage (+1)
4th best result = We both attack, full war (-1)

**Example 3: Prisoners Dilemma**
Similar to war from above, but now the "3rd best" option from above is going to be the worst for us. Not confessing is a bigger risk.

---

#### 3) 3 types of equilibrium

**1st - Dominant Strategy Equilibrium**
Strictly dominant strategy = choice that earns higher payoff than any other strategy.
If both players have a strictly dominant strategy, the result will be a **dominant strategy equilibrium**
There is only one possible solution. Sometimes there is no answer.
Example: Negative political ads

**2nd - Iterated-Dominant Strategy Equilibrium**
Example: Pig Push vs Not
Players will elimate dominated strategies until they find a solution.

**3rd - Nash Equilibrium**
The equilibrium where neither player would be better off making a change
Pure strategy (predictable) = decision rule that does not involve randomizing
$\quad$ Remember the example in class - driving a car has 2 equib
Mixed strategy (unpredictable) = sometimes choose one, sometimes choose the other

$\quad$ **Finding a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium to a game like matching pennies**
$\quad$ (1) Define possible mixed strategies
$\quad$ (2) Identify each players best reply function (the best response to each possible move by the opponent)
$\quad$ (3) Mixed stratgy nash equilibrium = where the best replies of each player equal one another

-----

### 3.3 Dynamic Games + Perfect Information

**Nodes**

- Decision node | Any point where a player is making a decision
- Initial node | 1st decision
- Terminal node | Bottom of lowest branches

**Threats**

- False belief | If I do "x", they'll do "y". (Wrong)
- Credible threat | If I do "x", they'll do "y". (Right)

---

### 3.4 Repeated games

**Finite repeated games**
Tit for tat = Cooperate with competitor because it helps us.

**Infinite repeated games (super games)**
Trigger strategy | They cooperated with us last time, we will this time, they will next time, etc.

To solve, we have to decide whether the PV of all future returns from cooperating is greater than competing

$\pi \quad$ = **5mil** (payoff from cooperating each period)
$PV \: \:$ = **10mil** (payoff for competing in first period, 0 afterwards)
$\beta \quad$ = Discount factor (.9 would be someone who cares about the future a alot)

$ Value(\pi,\infty) = \frac{\pi}{1-\beta} = PV $

$ Value(\pi,\infty) = \frac{5}{1-\beta} \geq 10 $
So in this example, we should only cooperate if our discount value is $\geq$ than .5

## Ch 4: Behavioral Economics

**4.1 Why we make mistakes**
**4.2 Salience**
**4.3 Framing Effects**
**4.4 If it makes you happy**
**4.5 Choices under risk and uncertainty**
**4.6 Time inconsistent preferences**

### 4.1 Why we make mistakes

1. **Bounded rationality:** We are bounded by our ability to obtain info + handle complex issues.
   1. Gathering is costly
   2. Processing is costly
2. **Emotional and stressful** to compare complex items
3. **Dual Systems** (Daniel Kahneman)
   1. **Intuition:** Quick, easy, autopilot choices (Limbic system - emotion, pain, pleasure)
   2. **Reasoning:** Deliberate and effortful thought (Frontal lobe - higher order mental functions)

### 4.2 Salience

**Salience:** How striking/memorable something is.
Example: CFB polls weekly AP rankings - win/loss is more salient than margin of victory, home or away, etc

### 4.3 Framing Effects

**Framing effects:** how information is presented

1) **False beliefs**
   $\quad$ (a) Marketers promote misinfo when it yields higher returns
   $\quad$ (b) Consumers accept misinformation when it makes them happier
   $\quad$ (c) Beliefs spread from consumer-to-consumer

2) **Anchoring:** Influenced by irrelevant information
   $\quad$ Group 1 - How many dates have you been on this month? How happy are you? .66 correlation
   $\quad$ Group 2 - How happy are you? How many dates have you been on this month? .12 correlation

3) **Default effects:** Tendency to choose default
   $\quad$ (a) Helps cope with anxiety
   $\quad$ (b) Some view the default as the recommendation
   $\quad$ (c) May prefer the status quo and due to loss aversion
   $\quad$ Example: Organ donor program in 7 European countries
   $\qquad$ When default is organ donor = 97.4% enrollment
   $\qquad$ When default is NOT organ donor = 18% enrollment

### 4.4 Poor decisions for comfort

1) **Overconfidence:** Tend towards overconfident when assessing own abilities

2) **Confirmation bias:** Accept info that supports their view, reject info that doesn't

3) **Cognitive Dissonance:** When actions diverge from beliefs
   $\quad$ (1) Change belief (2) change behavior (3) accept false-belief

---

### 4.5 Choice under risk and uncertainty

**Reference point:** Under uncertainty, people make choices relative to a reference point (often the status quo or current choice)

(1) **Reference dependence:** different reference points leads to different choices
$\quad$ A rich person would be willing to pay 100 dollars for high end wine, poor person only willing to pay 5 dollars

(2) **Endowment effects:** people place greater value on what they already own
$\quad$ Status quo: People prone to making decisions consistent with the current state
$\quad$ Loss aversion: eople weigh losses heavier than gains

(3) **Signals of quality:** people experience greater pleasure from product if they think its high quality beforehand

---

### 4.6 Time-Inconsistent Preferences

(1) **Discounting:** People tend to value benefits more the sooner they are obtained

$PV(U,t) = D^{t}U$
Present value (PV) of utility (U) recieved in period (t) = utility (U) times the discount rate (D) raised to the number of periods ahead (t)
Notice that the discount function is exponential

**Time inconsistency:** people tend to be more impatient when comparing today vs tomorrow  than when comparing 30 days from now vs 31 days from now

(2) **Neuroeconomics** says there are two interacting brain systems involved in intermporal choice
$\quad$ (a) One concerned with immediate outcomes
$\quad$ (b) One concerned with future outcomes
Discount rates are NOT constant over time.
Implication: Reduce the cost of first purchase. Boost temptation of instant gratification.
$\quad$ Hyperbolic discount: when you value the future as nothing. All that matters is now.
$\qquad$ Cocaine addicts

(3) **Impulsivity**
$\quad$ Sources: time pressure, high pressure sales pitch, cognitive overload with multiple tasks, sleep deprive, stress

(4) **Addiction and cues:**
$\quad$ Cold state: noncraving state
$\quad$ Hot state: vunerable to craving
$\qquad$ Environmental cues will lead to greater demand for good when exposed to cue

---

### 4.7 Economics and Identity

(1) **Groups:** People can experience loss in utility if they take actions that go against the group
(2) **Prestige or snob:** jumping to a "higher" social group
(3) **Mass market:** people who like to associate with a large social group will jump on the bandwagon
(4) **Niche market:** people who like to set themselves apart will associate with a smaller niche market

### 4.8 Questions

#### Problem 1

Kahneman: "People sometimes answer a difficult question by answering an easy one instead."
Relate this to the dual systems approach.

**Answer:**
Dual Systems - Kahneman
$\quad$ (a) Intuition: quick, easy, autopilot choices (limbic system - emotion, pain, pleasure)
$\quad$ (b) Reasoning: deliberate and effortful thought (frontal lobe - higher order mental functions)

Answering a difficult question requires "reasoning", which is an uncomfortable state relative to using intuition. Answering an easy question instead allows the person to use "intuition" which is quicker and easier to use.

#### Problem 5

People checked Zillow and saw their house valued at 500k.
They list the house for 500k.
The house sells for 490k.
Would the house have sold for 490k if they listed it for 400k?
What behavioral concept related to 400k?

**Answer:**
The house probably would not have sold for 490k if it was originally listed at 400k.
Under uncertainty (not knowing the true value of the house), people make choices relative to a reference point (initial price). The eventual sale price of the house is dependent on the initial valuation by the sellers.

___

#### Problem 6

Jed has a test tomorrow. He estimates he needs to study for 3 more hours. He goes to a party instead.
Before the test, Jed tells himself he has studied a lot that semester + done well on previous test.
Is this cognitive dissonance or loss aversion?

**Answer:**
This is cognitive dissonance. His original belief was that he needed to study for 3 more hours. The action that he took was studying for 0 hours. He decided to change his belief so that he did not have to study.

Cognitive Dissonance: When actions diverge from beliefs...
$\quad$ Must change belief, change behavior, or accept false belief

---

#### Problem 9

Does procrastination relate to time-inconsistent preferences?

**Answer:**
Yes.

The concept of *discounting* tells us that people tend to value benefits more the sooner they are obtained.
*Time inconsistency* tells us that people tend to be more impatient when comparing today vs tomorrow than when comparing 30 days from now vs 31 days from now.

When we procrastinate, we are valuing current benefits (leisure time) higher in the short term. We are also more impatient and want benefits quicker right away (now vs tomorrow) than (next Tuesday vs next Wednesday) due to time inconsistency.

---

#### Problem 10

What is meant by "precommitment"?
Can you think of an example of strategies for physical exercise?

**Answer:**
Precommitment reflects an understanding of our own time-inconsistent preferences. We know that we will be impatient and decide that we want to receive benefits now (relaxation) instead of exercising to receive benefits later (long term health).

Precommitment would tie us into obligations that we can't get out of so that we will do whats best for us in the long term. Examples would be prepaying for a gym membership, making plans to go with someone you know, etc.

# 5-7

## Ch 5: Perfect Competition & Market Imperfections

**Market**: Collection of all buyers and sellers, including substitute goods
**Industry** (ignores buyer side): Collection of firms that sell substitute goods

### 5.1 Perfect Competition Assumptions

(a) Profit maximizers
(b) Perfectly homogenous goods
(c) Many identical firms. Price is exogenous to the firm.
(d) There are no barriers to entry or exit.
(e) No frictions or other market imperfections. Transaction costs are equal, buyers and sellers understand the market.

### 5.2 Perfect Competition Firm Behavior

(1) Demand and Revenue
$\quad$ (a) Individual firm demand curve is a flat horizontal line (ie demand curve is perfectly elastic.)

$MR = AR = P = demand$

$Profit = TR-TC$ $\quad and \quad$ $TR'(Q)=TC'(Q)=p$

### 5.3 Market Equilibrium and Long Run Supply

(1) 3 conditions will hold when there is **long run equilibrium** in perfect competition:
$\quad$ (a) The market will clear (ie demand = long run supply)
$\quad$ (b) Equilibrium price will equal long run marginal cost
$\quad$ (c) Firm economic profit = 0. (If there is profit to be made, new firms will enter which drives price down)
$\qquad$ (ie firm economic profit = 0 when price = long run average cost)

---

(2) Long run industry supply curve: **Constant cost:** increase or decrease in supply **does not** impact input prices
$\quad$ (i) AC and MC remain constant
$\quad$ (ii) Long run equilibrium cost fixed at minimum AC
$\quad$ (iii) Long run industry supply curve is a horizontal line
$\quad$ (iv) Equilibrium price determined by technology (minimum AC)
$\quad$ (v) Equilibrium quantity determined by demand

---

(3) Long run industry supply curve: **Increasing cost:** increase or decrease in supply **does** impact input prices
$\quad$ (i) AC & MC & price increase as production grows
$\quad$ (ii) Long run supply reflects long run cost of production - supply price = MC = AC
$\qquad$ (iii) Function of price, input prices, and technology

---

(4) **Price elasticity of supply** = $\frac{\%\Delta \: Quantity \:supplied \: of \: a \: good}{\%\Delta \: Price \: of \: the \: good}$

Partial derivative: **Price elasticity of supply** = $\frac{\partial \: Q}{P}$ * $\frac{P}{Q}$

Elasticity will be **positive** for the **increasing cost** industry

### 5.4 Comparitive Statics

**Comparitive statics:** analysis of change in endo variables resulting from change in exo variables
$\quad$ We compare the two static equilibria, ignore the process to go from one to the next

$$\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta E} = \frac{rE}{(1-p)}$$

How will an outside variable effect our outcome?
E represents a variable outside of our model

### 5.5 Efficiency and welfare

**Desirable market performance has 4 criteria:**
(1) Macro stability
(2) Equitable
(3) Dynamically efficient
(4) Statically efficient

$\quad$ **Firm level:**
$\qquad$ (1) **Technical efficiency:** using minimum quantity to inputs to produce output (not using too much capital or labor)
$\qquad$ (2) **Economic efficiency:** produces output at lowest cost combo (noone would be better off by having those resources used somewhere else)

$\quad$ **Industry level:**
$\qquad$ (3) **Productive efficiency:** produces output at minimum cost - lowest cost combo
$\qquad\quad$ (i) **Cost minimizing industry structure:** number of firms that minimizes industry production cost

$\qquad$ (4) **Allocative efficiency:** produces socially desirable level of output (ie society marginal benefit = marginal cost of production)
$\qquad\quad$ (i) **Consumer surplus:** price I would pay (minus) what I actually paid
$\qquad\quad$ (ii) **Producer surplus:** price I recieve (minus) opportunity cost of inputs used
$\qquad\quad$ (iii) **Total surplus:** measures total social welfare (CS + PS)
$\qquad\qquad$ (a) Maximized when equilibrium price = marginal cost (ie allocatively efficient)

**Summary:** Perfectly competitive market is statically efficient,  all firms are technically and economically efficient,  and the industry is productively and allocatively efficient

### 5.6 Market Failure, Limits of Perfect Competition

**Market failure: when markets fail to maximize total surplus**

(1) Monopoly or market power: firms are able to maintain equilibrium price above long run MC
$\quad$ (i) Too little output is produced, allocative efficiency suffers

(2) Externalities (spillover): receiving a benefit even though you didn't help (eg a firm polluting a river)
$\quad$ These arise when the marginal cost of production for the firm is less than the marginal cost to society
$\quad$ Network externality: one persons demand for a good depends on other people's demand for the good (picking the right online dating site)

(3) Public goods
$\quad$ (i) Nonrivalry in competition: my use doesn't diminish the quantity/quality for others
$\quad$ (ii) Nonexclusion: think radio broadcasts

(4) Imperfect info
$\quad$ (i) Lemons problem: if consumers can't distinguish between high and low quality, high quality will be pushed out
$\quad$ (ii) Cognitive weakness: fail to accurately assess info
$\qquad$ (1) Framing, anchoring, default effects, overconfidence, over-exuberance

**Network externality:** your demand depends on my demand (sets up the market to avoid competition)
**Cognitive issues**
**Free rider problem:** using a public good without paying for it

#### Problem 10

What is the difference between **economic efficiency** and **productive efficiency**?

**Answer:**
Economic efficiency is at the firm level, productive efficiency is at the industry level. Both refer to producing a given quantity of the lowest cost combo.

- **Economic Efficiency**: a situation in which nothing can be improved without something else being hurt.
- **Productive Efficiency**:  maximum number of goods and services are produced with a given amount of inputs

*Desirable market performance has 4 criteria:*
(1) Macro stability
(2) Equitable
(3) Dynamically efficient
(4) Statically efficient
$\quad$ *Firm level:*
$\qquad$ (1) *Technical efficiency:* using minimum quantity to inputs to produce output
$\qquad$ (2) *Economic efficiency:* produces output at minimum cost - lowest cost combo
$\quad$ *Industry level:*
$\qquad$ (3) *Productive efficiency:* produces output at minimum cost - lowest cost combo
$\qquad$ (4) *Allocative efficiency:* produces socially desirable level of output (ie society marginal benefit = marginal cost of production)

---

#### Problem 11

Give an example of:

- **Public good**: city park, able to use for free
- **External benefit**: UNC basketball gets lots of media attention, non-student athletes want to attend too. Able to price higher, increase profits
- **External cost**: BP oil spill
- **Network externality**: everyone else has an iPhone and they work well together, I should just get one too

## 6 Monopoly

### 6.1 Monopoly

**Monopoly: industry with only one seller**
Monopoly can refer to a firm, an industry, or a market structure

**Assumptions of monopoly:**
(1) Only one firm in the market.
(2) Protected from competition by barriers to entry
$\quad$ (i) **Natural barrier:** scale economy, noone else can profitably enter
$\quad$ (ii) **Legal barrier:** eg patent
$\quad$ (iii) **Strategic barrier:** actions by the firm to prevent others from entering
(3) Monopolists demand = market demand. Slope is negative. Firm is price maker.
(4) Firm seeks to max profits. There are no frictions / other market imperfections.

#### 6.1.1 Firm Behavior & Market Equilibrium

##### General rules for a monopoly

**Demand & MR curves are downward sloping. Firm demand is industry demand.**
Long run profit maximized when MC = MR

$P = AR > MR \quad$ Price set is the same as average revenue, which will be greater than marginal revenue.

$a > c > 0\quad$ Price intercept will be greater than the long run marginal & average costs, which will both be positive.

---

###### Parameters

Inverse demand curve: $P = a - bQ $
Y-intercept: $a$
Slope of demand curve: $b$

###### Total Revenue

$TR = (a-bQ)*Q $

$TR = aQ - abQ^2 $

###### Total Costs

$TC = c*Q \quad $ eg each unit costs 3 dollars

###### Profit Equation

$\pi = TR - TC$

$\pi = (aQ - abQ^2) - (cQ) $

---

##### Take derivative to determine maximum profit

$\frac{\partial\pi}{\partial Q}$  = $\frac{\partial TR}{\partial Q}$

- $\frac{\partial TC}{\partial Q}$

<font size="2">
$0 = MR - MC $
</font>

<font size="2">
$0 = a-2bQ-c $
</font>  

**Profit maximizing quantity:**
<font size="3">
$ Q
= \frac{a-c}{2b} $
</font>

**Profit maximizing price:**
<font size="3">
$ P
= \frac{a+c}{2} $
</font>

**Profit maximization:**
<font size="3">
$ \pi
= \frac{{(a-c)}^2}{4b} $
</font>

**English Translation:**
When our inverse demand curve is $P = a - bQ $ and our total costs grows linearly with relation to our quantity produced, we should produce
<font size="3">
$
\frac{{(a-c)}^2}{4b} $
</font>
which is
<font size="3">
$
\frac{{(Y\:intercept\:-\:cost\:per\:unit)}^2}{4\:*\:slope\:of\:the\:demand\:curve} $
</font>

---

#### 6.1.2 No Supply Curve in Monopoly

There is no supply curve in a monopoly because the quantity to produce only depends on the demand curve.

---

#### 6.1.3 Allocative Inefficiency

In perfect competition, the firm produces quantity (q) where price (p) equals marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC).
In a monopoly, however, the firm will produce less quantity and will charge a higher price. This leads to allocative inefficiency (from society's perspective).

This is called **market power**. To measure market power, we calculate the Lerner Index.

---

**Lerner Index:**
In monopoly, Lerner Index = $\frac{1}{Price\:elasticity\:of\:demand} $
As elasticity of demand goes up, market power decreases and Lerner index decreases

If the price elasticity of demand stays constant when for a small increase in price, then the firm will pass added costs onto the consumer at a greater than 1:1 rate (eg for a \$1 increase in cost, the firm will rise prices greater than 1.)

The **Lerner Index** is inversely related to the **price elasticity of demand**.

---

#### 6.1.4 X-inefficiency and Rent Seeking

**Social welfare is measures by total surplus.**
**X-ineffiency arises from protection of the firm from competition.**

Firms can operate above their cost function due to
(1) lax work effort and
(2) cognitive errors
These errors are more likely to occur in a monopoly setting due to lack of competition "pushing" the firm.

**Rent seeking behavior:** investing resources into activities to retain monopoly power.
Wasteful because it is (1) costly and (2) does not lead to increase in output.

---

#### 6.1.5 Dynamic (Addiction, Product Durability)

Remember that dynamic efficiency is #3 in the social welfare maximization requirements below.

In a dynamic (multi period) market, firm chooses production today that maximizes sum of profits today + in future.
Addictive products and durable products are treated in opposite ways.
An increase in production of addictive goods today will benefit demand in the future (getting people hooked).
An increase in production of durable goods today will decrease demand in the future.
$\quad$ If product durability is under the control of the monopolist, "planned obsolescence" may become profitable strategy.

##### Profit Function

<font size="3">
$\pi_{Total} = \pi_{Today} + \pi_{Future}$
</font>

---

##### Derivative of profit with respect to production today

The effects on profit of a marginal increase in price will be **positive** for addictive goods and **negative** for durable goods.
$$
0 = MR_{Today} - MC_{Today} +\frac{\partial\pi_{Future}}{\partial Quantity_{Today}}
$$

---

##### Four types of static efficiency

**Firm level:**
(a) **Technical efficiency:** using minimum quantity to inputs to produce output
(b) **Economic efficiency:** produces output at minimum cost - lowest cost combo

**Industry level:**
(c) **Productive efficiency:** produces output at minimum cost - lowest cost combo
(d) **Allocative efficiency:** produces socially desirable level of output (ie society marginal benefit = marginal cost of production)

### 6.2 Monopolistic Competition

Monopolistic competition: firms are assumed to be so small that strategic interaction is nonexistent. No game theory required.

**Assumptions of monopolistic competition:**
(1) Many ID firms, no strategic interaction
(2) Differentiated products: same basic function, slight differences
(3) No barriers to entry or exit
(4) Profit maximizers, no friction or other market imperfections
(5) There are economies of scale in production

---

**Long run equilibrium:**
(1) Each firm has monopoly over their own brand, so demand curves downward sloping (price makers)
(2) Free entry means that long run profits are 0.
$\quad$ That is, price equals long run average costs. This is the point where demand = AC.
$\quad$ Long run average costs are greater than long run marginal costs. Long run econ profits are 0.

**Social welfare maximization for monopolistic competition:**
Pros: Greater product variety for consumers
Cons: Allocatively inefficient, production is below efficient scale. Cost is pretty small though

Without economies of scale, each monopolistic competition firm would just become perfect competition instead.

### 6.3 Questions

#### Problem 2

A textbook author sells right of book to publisher.
Publisher has a monopoly over the book.
Authors are paid a percent of total revenue.
Show that the **author** will prefer to sell more books than the **publisher**.

**Answer:**
The author wants to maximize revenue for the book, while the publisher wants to maximize profit for the book.
The publisher would prefer to produce less quantity than is demanded in order to maintain pricing power to max profit.

---

#### Problem 4

A monopoly producer charges 1USD for their product.
Assume that:
(1) The monopoly is maximizing profit and
(2) Price elasticity of demand at 1USD is 2. ($\eta$ = 2)

Calculate MC and MR.

```python
import sympy as sym
from sympy import *

L = sym.Symbol('L') # Lerner index, scale from 0 to 1
MC = sym.Symbol('MC') # Marginal cost
p = sym.Symbol('p') # Price
n = sym.Symbol('n') # Price elasticity of demand

# Parameters we were given in the problem
n = 2 #price elasticity of demand at 1 dollar is 2
p = 1

# Equation to calulate marginal cost
MC = p * (1 - (1/n))

# Solve
print("Marginal cost = ", MC)
```

    Marginal cost =  0.5

**Lerner Index:**
In monopoly, Lerner Index = $\frac{1}{Price\:elasticity\:of\:demand} $

As elasticity of demand goes up, market power decreases and Lerner index decreases

If the price elasticity of demand stays constant when for a small increase in price, then the firm will pass added costs onto the consumer at a greater than 1:1 rate (eg for a \$1 increase in cost, the firm will rise prices greater than 1.)

The **Lerner Index** is inversely related to the **price elasticity of demand**.

#### Problem 8

"Learning by doing": workers & mgmt more productive as they become more familiar with experience.
When this happens, what will the slope of profit be from period one to period two?
$$
\frac{\partial \: Profit \: period \: 2}{\partial \: Quantity \: period \: 1} = \frac{\partial\pi_{II}}{\partial q_{I}}
$$

The slope of profit will be positive from period one to period two. As workers become more productive, they are able to produce the same quantity in less time and with a lower cost. This, in turn, increases their profit.

---

#### Problem 12

Consider an established monopoly firm. How does the the behavioral concept of the **endowment effect** relate to barriers to entry in the industry?

**Answer:**
When people are making a decision under uncertainty between a new vs old product, it may be difficult to get consumers to switch away from what they already know. It's easier to go with the status quo.

**Endowment effects:** people place greater value on what they already own
$\quad$ Status quo: People prone to making decisions consistent with the current state
$\quad$ Loss aversion: eople weigh losses heavier than gains

## Ch 7: Product Differentiation

**What is product differentiation?**

**Law of one price** = when every product is the same and when every customer is perfectly informed, each firm will charge the same price

According to Lancaster:
(1) Products in different markets when they serve different functions
(2) Differentiated products when same market (serve same function) but have different characteristics

According to Chamberlin:
(1) Objective characteristics: tangible, real differentiation
(2) Subjective characteristics: perceived product differentiation

---

**Sources of product differentiation:**

(1) Physical differences in the products
(2) Differences in service quality by the seller
(3) Differences in geo location
(4) Differences in product image among customers
(5) Differences in quality

### 7.1 Types of Product Diff (Objective)

(1) Multichar product diff
(2) Horizontal product diff - only one char differs, people disagree over preference (eg color of car)
(3) Vertical product diff - only one char differs, everyone agrees (eg quality)

---

**Solving the following problems:**
(1) Determine the utility functions for choosing each of the firms
(2) Set the utility functions equal to one another
(3) Isolate the "choice desirability" variable. This is the quantity demanded for firm 1. Use this to set the profit equation.
(4) Take (1 - quantity demanded) for firm 2. Use this to set the profit function.  
(5) Take the derivative for firm 1 and solve for price of firm 1.
(6) Take the derivative for firm 2 and solve for price of firm 2.
(7) Plug firm 2's price into the firm 1 profit derivative to solve for firm 1 profit max price.
(8) Optional: Take this price and plug it into firm 2's price equation. This will give the optimal price to set for both firm 1 and for firm 2.

---

### 7.2

#### 7.2.2 Horizontal (Gas station, Salop model)

Horizontal product diff -- only one char differs, people disagree over preference (eg color of car)

V = free gas + free delivery
P = Our price
$P_{N}$ = Their price
T = transportation costs
X = Distance to travel
D = Degree of substitutability

**In the scenario where product differentiation is due to geographic location, the price we should charge is our marginal cost + the cost the customer will need to pay to get to us.**

---

#### Horizontal example - Salop Model (circle)

We get to choose advertising costs and our own price

V = free gas + free delivery
P = Our price
$P_{N}$ = Their price
T = transportation costs
X = Distance to travel
A = Advertising
C = Marginal cost

---

#### 7.2.3 Vertical, circle

Vertical product diff - only one char differs, everyone agrees (eg quality)

---

#### Vertical example - Hotelling

![salop.PNG](attachment:salop.PNG)

### 7.3 Questions

---

#### Problem 1

Provide examples of the following types of product differentiation.

**Multicharacterisic diff:** when products differ over a variety of characteristics
(1) Houses
(2) Cars

**Horizontal diff:** people disagree over preferences
(1) Flavors of bagels
(2) Colors of cars given they are all the same kind

**Vertical diff:** people agree that one is better than the other
(1) Craftsman vs knock offs
(2) Nike vs knockoff

---

#### Problem 2

How do changes in key parameters impact firm demand in each type of prod diff?

**Multicharacterisic diff:** when products differ over a variety of characteristics
Equation for firm 1:
$Price = Y\:intercept - q_{1} - degree \: of \: differentiation * q_{2} $

(1) Greater Y intercept = greater demand
(2) Degree of differentiation = greater demand

---

**Horizontal diff:** people disagree over preferences
Equation for firm 1:
$ q_{1} = Number \: of \: customers * \frac{t - p_{1} + p_{2}}{2t} $
(1) Number of total possible customers goes up = greater demand
(2) Greater transportation costs = indeterminant change on demand

---

**Vertical diff:** people agree that one is better than the other
Equation for firm 1:
$ q_{1} = Number \: of \: customers * (Preference_{High preference} - \frac{p_{1}}{quality} + \frac{p_{2}}{quality}) $
(1) Number of total possible customers goes up = greater demand
(2) Increase in market size from taste preference = greater demand

---

#### Problem 8

Assume a market with
(1) 2 firms
(2) vertical diff (people agree of quality diff)
(3) One high quality, one low quality

How would demand of each change with an increase in disposable income?

**Answer:**
As disposable income increases in a market with two goods, demand for the higher quality item will increase and demand for the lower quality item will fall. If the higher quality firm decides to raise prices as a result, the lower quality firm will be able to raise their prices as well. This is because the cost-benefit tradeoff (indifference point) will change as the high quality firm raises their price.

## 8 Market Structure

**8.1 Delinearization**
**8.2 Industry Concentration**
**8.3 Industry Concentration (US only)**
**8.4 Determinants of market structure**

---

### 8.1 Delinearization of market structure

**Oligopoly:**
Possible product differentiation
Barriers to entry exist
Few firms account for bulk of production
Price is endogenous

---

### 8.2 Industry concentration

**Industry concentration:** number + size of firms

**Concentration curve:** cumulative market share of sales from largest firm to smallest
**Index of concentration:** should take into account size distribution of firms.  
$\quad$ Greater concentration when number of firms declines + larger firm gains market share from smaller firm

**Dominant firm:** takes leadership role in setting P or Q due to their product diff or cost leadership (higher concentration)

---

#### Defining a market (Dept of Justice)

Economic market factors: Geographic, product

1) Products where buyers would switch if we raised prices by 5%
2) Products of potential competitors if everyone in our market raised prices by 5% with 1 year

---

#### Measuring concentration with an index

1) Number of firms

---

2) **k-firm**: sum of the market share % of the "k" largest firms
   $\quad$ no info of market share distribution, ignores smaller firms

$CR_k = \sum_{i=1}^k{s_i}$

---

3) **HHI index:** sum of squared **k-firm** from above
   $\quad$ Ranges from 0 to 1 (invest in higher companies)
   $\quad$ Decreases as number of firms increases
   $\quad$ Increases with variance in market share
   $\quad$ 1500-2500 = moderate concentration
   $\quad$ 2500-10000 = concentrated (merger that increases by 200 creates concerns)

$HHI = \sum_{i=1}^k{s_i^2}$

$HHI = n\sigma^2 + \frac{1}{n} $

---

#### Some Guidelines ####

$\begin{array}{lr}
\text{Herfindahl Range} & \text{Interpretation} \\
\hline
HHI < 0.01 & \text{Highly Competitive} \\
0.01 < HHI < 0.15 & \text{Unconcentrated} \\
0.15 < HHI < 0.25 & \text{Moderate Concentration} \\
0.25 < HHI  & \text{High Concentration}

---

#### Problem 2

Index of concentration:
a) Describe ideals of an index of industy concentration
b) Do the three indices meet these ideals chars?
c) How is HHI related to $CR_{4}$ and $n$?

**Answer:**

b) $n$ - No, does not show size distribution
$\quad CR_{4}$ - No, does not show market share of the rest of the firms
$\quad$ HHI - Yes

c) $HHI = n\sigma^2 + \frac{1}{n} $

---

#### Problem 4

a) Describe what is meant by aggregate concentration.
b) How has aggregate concentration in the US changed in the last half century?
c) Interpret value from table
d) Why might high aggregate concentration be a social concern?

**Answer:**
a) Aggregate concentration shows concentration in different markets in the US. It is measured by the % of sales going to firms from highest to lowest.

b) Info from table 8.4, pg 187. They only have data going until 1997 though.
Top 50: 17% cumulative share to 24%
Top 100: 23% cumulative share to 32%
Top 200: 30% cumulative share to 40%

c) Mean of $CR_{50}$ from 1947 to 1997 = 23.5
This means that, on average over this time period, the top 50 companies received 23.5% of sales in the manufacturing sector.

---

#### Problem 7

Explain how **strategic** barriers to entry are different than **natural** barriers to entry.
Provide an example of each.

**Answer:**
Strategic barriers are endogenous to the firm, natural barriers are exogenous to the firm.
Strategic = predatory pricing
Natural = economies of scale

## 9. Cartel Theory

### Overview

1. Why do firms form a cartel
2. How do firms price in a cartel
3. What happens to welfare
4. How do institutions influence cartel formation

---

### Cartel Unlikely when..

1. When they are illegal
2. Lots of firms
3. Cost differences
4. Instability in the market

---

### Strategies

#### 1) Market Division

1. Geographic - you get your territory, I get my territory
2. Customers

#### 2) (Price matching) Most-Favored Customer

Customer can come back and get rebate of price difference

#### 3) (Price matching) Meet the Competition

Price matching

#### 4) Trigger Strategy - keep using it until the other firm cheats

1. If the firm cheats today, they earn $\pi_B$, nothing afterwords
2. If the firm doesn't cheat they earn $\pi_C$ forever

### Review Questions

Assume a duopoly market (firms 1 and 2).
$pâ€‰=â€‰120â€‰âˆ’â€‰Q$ is the inverse market demand.
$Qâ€‰=â€‰q_1â€‰+â€‰q_2$ is the total market supply.  
$TC_i â€‰=â€‰20q_i$ is each firm's total cost equation (firms face the same costs).

A. Determine the cartel price and market level of output.
B. Explain why you cannot calculate the output and profit levels for each firm.

---

In the above problem, assume that firms are able to divide the market in half, so that each firmâ€™s inverse demand becomes  $p_i =â€‰120â€‰âˆ’â€‰2q_i$  Would this be an effective way to facilitate collusion?

### Ch 9 (Cartel) Review Questions: 4, 7, 8, 9, 10

---

#### Problem 4

For each pair of industries, which would you expect collusion to be easier to maintain?
A) Steel vs automobile
B) Cement vs wheat
C) Fast food vs airline service to one city

**Collusion is less likely to occur when:**

1) Cartels are illegal & penalties are steep
2) Many firms in the market
3) Differentiated costs & products
4) Demand & cost conditions unstable
5) Entry barriers low

**Answer:**
A) I would expect steel to be easier to maintain as steel is a more homogenous product
B) I would expect cement to be easier to maintain as there are far more wheat suppliers
C) I would expect airline service to be easier of the homogenous "product"

---

#### Problem 7

Office Depot, Office Max, and Staples compete in the office supply market by offering low-price guarantees (i.e., a meet-the-competition clause).  Are such guarantees beneficial or harmful to consumers? Explain.

**Answer:**
These are harmful to consumers as they prevent firms from differentiating through prices, and reduce customers willingness to shop around at different locations.

---

#### Problem 8

Assume that a market consists of three firms (1, 2, and 3) which form a cartel.  Firm 3 is a rogue firm that frequently undercuts the price of its competitors.  Could such behavior lead to even lower prices than would be found in competitive markets? Explain.

**Answer:**
Yes. In firm 3's attempt to gain control of the market, they could reduce their prices below their marginal costs. If firm 1 and 2 decide to punish firm 3, they could drop their prices in the short term until firm 3 is forced out of the market.

---

#### Problem 9

Suppose you were looking for an industry in which to form a cartel.  Given the empirical evidence, what would be the ideal set of conditions that would maximize the likelihood of cartel success?

**Answer:**

**Collusion is MORE likely to occur when:**

1) Penalties for antitrust aren't too steep
2) Few firms in the market
3) Homogenous costs & products
4) Demand & cost conditions stable
5) Entry barriers high

---

#### Problem 10

Provide a behavioral reason why it could be more difficult to establish and maintain an effective cartel among firms in different nations, such as the OPEC cartel, than among firms within a single nation, such as the steel cartel in the USA during the early twentieth century.

**Answer:**
Political tension. For example, oil importing countries were not happy with Egypt and Syria's invasion of Israel. This led to an "exporter vs importer" tensions. Countries who supported Israel (eg USA) faced much higher prices than they had before.

## 13 Product Design, Multiproduct Production, Brand Proliferation

**13.1 Product Design (pg 344)**
Choice of vertical characteristic (quality)
Choice of horizontal characteristic
Mass market & niche market product design

**13.2 Multiproduct Production (pg 358)**
Motives for multiproduct production
Multiproduct production in monopoly

**13.3 Brand Proliferation (pg 367)**

---

### 13.1 Product Design

#### 1) Choice of Vertical Characteristic (Quality)

**Primary results:**

1) Optimal quality increases when **marginal effectiveness** of quality increases
2) Optimal quality increases when **marginal cost** of quality decreases

**Socially optimal level of quality:**
No change in quality when firms doesn't see corresponding P increase.
$\quad$ This results in too low of quality from society perspective

#### 2) Choice of Horizontal Characteristic (Locations)

**Primary results:**

1) Monopoly will choose the socially optimal level of horizontal char (such as location)
2) Firms move too far apart from society's perspective with increased competition

#### 3) Mass Market and Niche Market

**Primary results:**

1) Including additional features and making products appealing to the masses will **flatten** demand curve
2) Designing niche products will make the demand curve **steeper** and focus on those at the top

---

### 13.2 Multiproduct Production

**Motives:** Multiproduction happens when there is some kind of synergy

1) Reduce overall risk
2) Higher valued products / lower cost of producion (complements in prod)
3) Demand synergies that enhance product value
4) Hail mary when firm is struggling
5) Strategic considerations

---

##### Monopoly

**Demand Independence (unrelated goods) in a monopoly:**
Firm will act as a seperate monopoly in each product

**Demand Dependence in a monopoly:**

1) The firm will charge a **higher** price when the goods are **substitutes** than if they were independent
2) The firm will charge a **lower** price when the goods are **complements** than if they were independent (loss leader)

---

##### Oligopoly

1) A large firm is better off using profits from one market to subsidize predatory tactics in another
2) Large corps who compete in many markets likely to adopt "live and let live"

---

### 13.3 Brand Proliferation

**Brand proliferation:**
Flooding the market with variety of different product to leave no room for entry for other firms

**Implications:**

1) Monopolist's loss min strategy is to crowd out potential entrants even if it means there is some cannibalization

---

### 13.4 Review

Assume a Hotelling location problem with four firms. The linear city is of unit length. Firms simultaneously choose their locations, but prices are assumed to be fixed. Find their Nash equilibrium locations. (Hint: you will find that all four firms will not choose the same location but that pairs of firms will cluster.)

Colgate and Crest each produce over 30 different brands of toothpaste.

1. When would this form of brand proliferation be socially desirable?
2. When would it be socially undesirable?
3. Why do you think Colgate and Crest offer so many brands?

Assume that a monopolist is concerned that another firm will enter its market. It is considering a brand proliferation strategy to deter entry. If the monopolist invests in a brand proliferation strategy, this raises its cost and the cost of the potential entrant by Ïƒâ€‰>â€‰0. Firms play a two-stage game. In the first stage, the monopolist (M) decides to invest in brand proliferation or not. In the second stage, the potential entrant (PE) decides to enter or not. Payoffs (Ï€) are as follows:

1. With no brand proliferation and no entry, Ï€ Mâ€‰=â€‰36 and Ï€ PEâ€‰=â€‰0.
2. With no brand proliferation and entry, Ï€ Mâ€‰=â€‰20 and Ï€ PEâ€‰=â€‰12.
3. With brand proliferation and no entry, Ï€ Mâ€‰=â€‰36â€‰âˆ’â€‰Ïƒ and Ï€ PEâ€‰=â€‰0.
4. With brand proliferation and entry, Ï€ Mâ€‰=â€‰20â€‰âˆ’â€‰Ïƒ and Ï€ PEâ€‰=â€‰12â€‰âˆ’â€‰Ïƒ.

Steps:

1. Describe this game in extensive form.
2. Identify the value of Ïƒ that will keep PE from entering the market.
3. Identify the value of Ïƒ that will make brand proliferation a profitable strategy for M.
4. Is this form of brand proliferation socially desirable? Explain.

---

Assume a monopoly firm is considering the production of two brands, 1 and 2.
Total cost is $TCâ€‰=â€‰20q_1â€‰+â€‰20q_2â€‰+â€‰\alpha$, where $q_i$ is the output of brand $i$ and $\alpha$ is a constant.  
The inverse demand for brand $i$ is $p_i â€‰=â€‰140â€‰âˆ’â€‰q_i â€‰âˆ’â€‰dq_j$, where iâ€‰â‰ â€‰j and d is a constant.
A. Determine the firmâ€™s optimal output ($q_i^*$), price ($p_i^*$), and profit ($\pi^*$).
B. Explain how the value of $\alpha$ affects the firmâ€™s profits.
C. If $\alpha=0$, how does a change in the degree of product differentiation affect firm profits?
Recall that product differentiation increases as d falls.

2) Applied reseach = designed to create knowledge that has a specific practical purpose

**Stages of tech change:**

1) Invent (create new idea / solve tech possibility)
2) Innovate (apply invention, result in new product / process)
3) Imitation (product is widely used)

**The government can:**

1) Subsidize
2) Create prizes
3) Create intellectual property rights

### Market Structure and Technological Change

**Trade secret:** alternate to patent
$\quad$ Better where you don't want to reveal what you are patenting (eg Coke recipe)

##### 1) Monopoly

![7.PNG](attachment:7.PNG)

---

##### 2) Monopoly vs Perfect Comp

![8.PNG](attachment:8.PNG)

**Implications:**

1) More R&D investment from firms with higher competition
   Potential issue: Over time, competing firms will be able to lower their MC as well. Imitation discourages R&D.

2) Society values innovation more than both monopolist and perfect comp
   Potential issue: Perfect comp doesn't have excess profits to invest. This makes R&D more expensive.

1) Price elasticity of demand falls and
2) Industry concentration (HHI) increases

![11.PNG](attachment:11.PNG)

---

#### Evidence

1. **Government incentives** - patent system and research grants
   $\quad$ 20% tax credit on R&D
   $\quad$ Government supplies 26% of grant funding
2. **Private firm incentives** - firms will invest when they will see the gains on investment
3. **Market structure** - no clear link.
   $\quad$ Arrow - Competitive firms will invest
   $\quad$ Schumpeter - Large firms in highly concentrated industries will invest
   $\quad$ Causal flow - a tech change may influence market structure

High tech firms invest more -- more patents
Some evidence that market structure effects R&D

### Questions

---

#### Problem 5

Explain how patents, copyrights, and trademarks may promote tech progress.
Why not give creative individuals and firms unlimited ownership of the outcomes of their work?

**Answer:**
The government wants to promote tech progress because, as the book states, 40-50% of US economic growth results from technological change.

Patents / copyrights / trademarks give the creator the rights to profit off of their invention.
If these rights were not in place, the potential profits may not make up for the cost from R&D.
Patents allow the creator to gain **market power** which will allow their revenue to overcome their R&D costs.

However, **market power** is allocatively inefficient. This is why we do not give firms unlimited ownership forever.

---

#### Problem 8

Coke has kept its recipe a secret for over 100 years.
Given that a patent lasts only 20 years, why don't all firms use the same strategy and keep their products a secret?

**Answer:**
The point of keeping a trade secret instead of filing a patent is that you don't have to share what you are actually patenting. The downside to this is that

1) someone could accidentally rediscover the "Coke recipe" on their own or  
2) one of the people that knows the Coke recipe could start their own company.
   In the case of Coke, only a few people know the recipe and these people are under contract to not share the recipe.

Other companies can't always do this if more than a few people need to know the special process to use.

#### Problem 12A

$P = 120 - Q$
$Q = Industry \: Quantity$

$Firm \: 1 \: TC = c*q$

They can invest in R&D that will bring marginal cost from 40 to 20.

How much will they be willing to invest if they are in:

1) Monopoly
2) Bertrand duopoly
3) Cournot duopoly

Which structure will the firm have greatest incentive to invest in?

**Answer:**
Bertrand will have greatest incentive to invest.

![12.PNG](attachment:12.PNG)

---

##### Bertrand (Choose P)

![13.PNG](attachment:13.PNG)

---

##### Cournot (Choose Q)

![14.PNG](attachment:14.PNG)

---

#### Problem 13

How can the act of creating new technologies and obtaining patents serve as a strategic barrier to entry?

**Answer:**

![10.PNG](attachment:10.PNG)

This can occur if it raises the sunk cost of entry as shown above.

---

#### Problem 16

Will an overconfident MGMT team invest too much or too little in R&D from the firm's prospective?
From society's perspective?

**Answer:**
It depends. If the firm thinks that R&D will help out more than it actually will, they will invest too much.

Society would benefit if the extra gain from this investment is greater than the allocative inefficiency of paying a price greater than the MC (eg life saving drugs that cost a ton).

### 18.2 Main Motivations

1) **Market power** - fewer competitors allows firm to increase price and profit (not socially desirable)
2) **Efficiency** - take advantage of economies of scale (socially desirable)
3) **Other**
   $\quad$ a) Reduce risk
   $\quad$ b) Government policy / tax advantages
   $\quad$ c) Principle agent

####  The Merger Paradox (firms in a merger don't necessarily earn greater profits)

The below profit equation is a Cournet model (firms choose Q).

$p=a-bQ$

a = Price intercept
b = Slope
c = Marginal cost
n = Number of firms before merge
m = Number of firms after merge

<font size="4">

**Before**
$\pi_i =\frac{(a-c)^2}{b(n+1)^2}$

**After**
$\pi_{i,m} =\frac{(a-c)^2}{b(n-m+2)^2}$

**But this must hold. Will only happen when .8*m > n**
$\frac{(a-c)^2}{b(n-m+2)^2}>\frac{m(a-c)^2}{b(n+1)^2}$

**Step 1: Profit** where $q_f$ represents how much total the other firms are producing
$\pi = (1- (q+q_f))q - q c$

**Step 2: Take derivative with respect to Q**
$q = \frac{1}{2} (1-c-q_f)$

**Step 3: Plug that q ^ into our original profit equation**
$\pi = \frac{1}{4} (c+q_f-1)^2$

**Step 4: This is the rate that a monopolist loses profit as the fringe production of others growing**
$\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta q_f} = \frac{1}{2} (c+q_f-1)$

### 18.3 Horizontal Mergers

1. Increase in Market Power - elimate competition by just buying the other firms
2. Buying other firms to lower our costs

---

### 18.4 Vertical Integration

Vertical integration --> buying up supply chain

1. It could increase efficiency
2. Or it could just increase market power

---

##### Motives

1. Technological Economies (Efficiency gains)
2. Hold up problems
3. Transaction costs
4. Quality of service

You are the CEO of the Macrosoft Corporation and decide to buy a custom motorcycle from US Choppers. The purpose of the motorcycle is to help promote your company, and your only request is that the Macrosoft logo be prominently displayed on the motorcycle.

**Explain how the hold-up problem applies to this purchase.**
There is no guarentee that I will buy the bike once they make it

**Who is at greater risk of being held up, you or US Choppers?**
US Choppers is at risk. If I decide I no longer want the motorcycle, they will sell for less to someone else

**Identify 2 ways in which to eliminate the hold-up problem.**  

1) Pay up front / set a contract
2) Buy US Choppers

### 18.5 Questions

---

#### Problem 1

Compare and contrast horizontal, vertical, and conglomerate mergers. What is the difference between a pure and an impure conglomerate merger?

**Answer:**
**Horizontal:** increase your economies of scale (increase market power, lower costs)
**Vertical:** buy up supply chain (increase efficiency, reduce costs)
**Conglomerate:** buying seemingly "unrelated" businesses under one umbrella
**Pure conglomerate:** The firms have completely unrelated products
**Impureconglomerate:** That firms' markets are not entirely seperate.

---

#### Problem 3

**Market-for-corporate-control hypothesis**

a) Explain the hypothesis & how it provides an efficiency motive for mergers
b) How can the **event study method** be used to test the hypothesis?
c) Explain how the hypothesis is derived from the efficienct market hypothesis.
$\quad$ What are the main weaknesses with the efficient market hypothesis & therefore the market for corp control hypothesis?

**Answer:**

a) The **market for corporate control hypothesis** says that poorly managed firms will face declining profits and ultimately face bankruptcy. Before they go bankrupt, a successful firm may purchase the failing firm and replace management. This threat of takeover will pressure management to **behave efficiently and in the interest of shareholders**.

b) The **event study method** says that mergers are motivated by 1) market power or 2) efficiency. If the merger is motivated by market power, merging and rival firms will see an increase in value. If the merger is motivated by efficiency, merging firms will increase in value but rival firms will decrease.

c) The **efficient market hypothesis** says that stock markets are informationally efficient. The price of each stock reflects all publicly available info and, therefore, reflects the fundamental value.

The **event study method** follows from this. If the efficient market hypothesis is correct, than we should be able to see the resulting movements (from part b) in price following a merger announcement.

**Weaknesses of event study:**

1) Most aquiring and rival firms are conglomerates, merger won't make that large of a difference
2) A merger may inform other firms of productivity gains and cause them to adopt the same practices

**Weaknesses of efficient market hypothesis:**

1) Behavioral economics - the presence of "noise traders" who value the firm incorrectly may cause other traders to avoid the stock.

---

#### Problem 7

What is the difference between upstream and downstream vertical merger?

**Answer:**

Both upstream and downstream involve buying up your supply chain.
An upstream merger is where you buy one of your input suppliers.
A downstream merger is where you buy a firm that purchases your product.

---

#### Problem 15

Provide two behavioral motives for conglomerate mergers.

**Answer:**

1) Empire building - psychological rewards from managing large corporations may be more meaningful than building the fundamental value of the firm.
2) Overdiversification - management can over diversify in order to reduce their direct exposure to risk even if the move has a negative impact on the firm

### Matching Pennies

- 2-player game
- Zero-sum game (1 winner, 1 loser)

"A" matrix | player on "left" side

- The first row of A is (1,-1) and the second row is (-1,1)

"B" matrix | player on "top" side

- The top row of B is represented by the first bracket pair []. The bottom row is represented by the next pair.

```python
A = [[1,-1],[-1,1]] 
B = [[-1,1],[1,-1]]

Pennies = nash.Game(A,B)
Pennies
```

```python
# Solve by plugging in probabilities. 

# .8 --> 80% of time, player A chooses 1st row
Player_1 = [.8, .2] 
Player_2 = [.6,.4]
Pennies[Player_1,Player_2]

# array([ 0.12, -0.12])
# The result of ".12" for Player A represents that they win 62% (50+12) of the time.

%matplotlib notebook
import scipy
import sympy as sym
sym.init_printing(use_unicode=False, wrap_line=True)
from scipy.misc import derivative
import numpy as np

Q = sym.Symbol('z')
```

### Define Function/Derivative

**Function**: $f(x) = 5x^5 - 3x^2 - 17$

**Derivative**: $f'(x) = 25x^4 - 6x $

```python
# Original function.
def f(x):
    return 5*x**5 - 3*x**2 - 17

# Derivative
def df(x):
    return sym.diff(f(x),x)

# Print derivative equation
print(df(x))
```

### Evaluate

```python
# Evaluate derivative at x=2

df(x).subs(x, 2)
print("Derivative at above point = ",df(x).subs(x,2))

# Result --> 388
```

### Find optimal

```python
# (1) take derivative
# (2) set equal to 0
# (3) solve

sym.solve(df(x))
# Only pay attention to real solutions, not imaginary
```

### Plot

x = np.linspace(-1,1,1000) # Domain of our plot

plt.figure()
plt.plot(x,f(x)) # This will be our original function
plt.axvline(color = 'black') # Setting our x and y axis as black
plt.plot(30**(1/3)/5, f(30**(1/3)/5),'o') # Plotting the points where our derivatives = 0
plt.plot(0,f(0),'o') # Plotting the points where our derivatives = 0
```

### 1. Symbols

$Q = Quantity$  $P = Price$  $a = Y\:intercept$  $b = slope$

```python
# Information we are given
a = 500
b = 5
#Q = 
P = 30
TC = 300
```

### 2. Demand

Inverse Demand (Whole Market):
$$P=a-bQ$$

Demand (Whole Market):
$$Q =\frac{a-P}{b}$$

---

Derivative of inverse demand (with respect to price): $$\:\: Q' =\frac{-1}{b}$$

```python
Q = (a - P) / b
P = a - b*Q
Qprime = (-1 / b)


print("Inverse demand curve is P = ", P)
print("Demand curve is Q = ", Q)
print("Derivative of the inverse demand curve is Q' = ",Qprime)
```

    Inverse demand curve is P =  30.0
    Demand curve is Q =  94.0
    Derivative of the inverse demand curve is Q' =  -0.2

---

### 3. Revenue & elasticity

Total Revenue: $$ TR = P(Q)\: \: *Q $$

Average Revenue: $$ AR = \frac{P(Q)Q}{Q}=P(Q) $$

Marginal Revenue: $$ MR = \frac{\partial  TR}{\partial Q} = \frac{\partial AR}{\partial Q}Q+AR $$

Marginal Revenue: $$ MR = P'(Q)Q + P(Q) $$

```python
TR = P * Q
AR = P * Q / Q
MR = sym.diff(TR)


print("Total Revenue = ",TR)
print("Average Revenue =", AR)
print("Marginal Revenue = ", MR)
```

    Total Revenue =  2820.0
    Average Revenue = 30.0
    Marginal Revenue =  0

---

### 4. Elasticity

Marginal Revenue and Elasticity: $$ MR = P(1 + \frac{1}{\varepsilon}) $$

Elasticity: $$Elasticity = \:\: Q' * \frac{P}{Q} \:\: = \:\: \frac{-1}{b} * \frac{a-bQ}{Q}$$

---

Income elasticity = $$\frac{dQ}{dm} * \frac{m}{Q}$$

Cross price elasticity of demand = $$\frac{dQ}{dP} * \frac{P}{Q}$$

```python
e = Qprime * P / Q 
print("Elasticity of demand = ",e)
```

    Elasticity of demand =  -0.06382978723404255

### 5. Profit Maximization Theory: ###

##### General Profit Equation: #####

$$\pi = P(Q)Q - C(Q)$$

##### Derivative: #####

$$\frac{d\pi}{dQ} = P'(Q)Q + P(Q)  - C'(Q)$$

##### Breaking down: #####

 $$\overbrace{\underbrace{P'(Q)Q}_{\text{Price Effect}} + \underbrace{P(Q)}_{\text{Quantity Effect}}}^{\text{Marginal Revenue}}  = \overbrace{C'(Q)}^{\text{Marginal Cost}}$$

---

### $Profit\:\: Maximization\:\: Example:$ ###

##### Parameters: #####

$$P = 1-Q\:and\:also\: TC = cQ$$

##### General Profit Equation: #####

$$\pi = \underbrace{P(Q)\:*\:Q}^{\text{Total Revenue}} -  \underbrace{c*Q}^{\text{Total Cost}}$$

##### Derivative: #####

$$\pi' = \underbrace{-Q+(1-Q)}^{\text{Marginal Revenue}} -  \underbrace{c}^{\text{Marginal Cost}} = 0$$

##### Isolating marginal cost: #####

$$c = -2Q + 1$$

##### Solving for quantity: #####

$$Q = \frac{1-c}{2}$$

```python
profit = TR - TC
profit_derivative = sym.diff(profit)

print("Profit equation = ", profit)
print("The derivative of profit equation. 0 = ", profit_derivative)
```

# Conclusions

### Intuition and Reasoning

**Intuition (Short)**: Our core driver from evolution. Primary focus is on emotions and pain/pleasure.

**Reasoning (Long)**: What sets us apart from other animals. Deliberate and effortful thought, focus is long-term

How much does someone value **right now** compared to **the future**? Would you rather have \$20 today or \$25 next month?

### Behavioral Economics

#### Bounded rationality

- Decision making is stressful & complicated. We try to gather just enough without overwhelming ourselves.
- Alternatives: Procrastinate, follow the social network instead

---

##### Framing Effects

**Framing effects:** how information is presented. Sets the "default" view.

###### Anchoring

Anchoring: The order of info matters

- Group 1 - How many dates have you been on this month? How happy are you? .66 correlation
- Group 2 - How happy are you? How many dates have you been on this month? .12 correlation
- For Group 1 - The happiness question was **anchored** by the dating question

###### Default options

We tend to go with the default option.

- (a) Helps cope with anxiety
- (b) Some view the default as the recommendation
- (c) Might feel like the "normal" thing to do

---

##### Short-term

1. Overconfidence: We tend to be overconfident when assessing their abilities
2. Confirmation bias: We accept info that supports their view, reject info that doesn't
3. Cognitive Dissonance: When actions diverge from beliefs. Must change belief, change behavior, or accept false belief

#### Time

**Discounting:** We tend to value today more than tomorrow

$PV(U,t) = D^{t}U$

Higher D = Higher weight on the future

- **Immediate gratification**: Reduce cost of first purchase, boost temptation of reward
- **Impulsivity**: Time pressure, cognitive overload, stress
- **Environmental cues**

#### Identity

1. **Groups:** A man wearing a dress will likely feel loss of identity in the male group. Other males will also feel loss of identity
2. **Prestige or snob:** jumping to a "higher" social group
3. **Mass market:** people who like to associate with a large social group will jump on the bandwagon
4. **Niche market:** people who like to set themselves apart will associate with a smaller niche market

#### Advertising

##### Informative

Informative: People collecting info is costly, ads let the company should price, features, etc

Signal of quality: Only successful companies can afford to advertise. If the company is able to continue to keep advertising, their product must be pretty good

##### Persuasive

Attempts to overcome cognitive dissonance.

Emphasize the benefits, downplay the negatives.

##### Subj Differentiation

**Name brands** able to charge a price premium for perceived quality
