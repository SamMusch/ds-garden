"The long-run trend leading to higher standards of living from generation to generation is not associated with any long-run trend in the rate of unemployment. By contrast, short-run movements in GDP are strongly correlated with the utilization of the economy’s labor force. The declines in the production of goods and services that occur during recessions are always associated with increases in joblessness." pg 334

"Most macroeconomists believe that the key difference between the short run and the long run is the behavior of prices. In the long run, prices are flexible and can respond to changes in supply or demand. In the short run, many prices are “sticky” at some predetermined level. Because prices behave differently in the short run than in the long run, various economic events and policies have different effects over different time horizons." pg 336

## Ch 2: Data

### Aggregate Income

Data comes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis

GDP = $Y = C + I + G + NX$

- I = investment
  - **Business fixed investment:** normal business investments
  - **Residential investment:** new housing by households and landlords
  - **Inventory investment:** increase in inventory

- GDP = Total Income = Total Expenditures

Real

- GDP Deflator = $\frac{Nominal \: GDP}{Real \: GDP}$
- Chain Weighted: Base year changes continuously over time: 2016 uses prices from 2016, 2017 uses prices from 2017

### Inflation Rate

Data comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics

**Price Indexes**: Fixed basket = Laspeyres, changing basket = Paasche

- CPI = basket of consumer goods
  - Core inflation = consumer basket without food or energy products because they are too volatile in the short term
  - Problems: Fixed basket of goods so it ignores substitution effects. Improved goods with no price change won't be reflected in CPI.

- PPI = Producer price index = basket of firms good
- GDP Inflator

### Unemployment Rate

Data comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (CPS: Current Population Survey)

1. Employed
2. Unemployed
3. Not in the labor force

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d43Z3GnTrqs): Employment to Population Ratio

- 18:43: "For every 1 unemployed prime age [25-54] guy, there are 3 guys who are neither working or looking for work."
- 36:06: "[In the US] We established disability programs for a reason, which was to protect people who could not work. It was one of the original aspects of our social security program. But to a great degree now, the disability programs now serve the preverse and unintended consequence of a sort-of alternative unemployment insurance."
- 37:00: "In 2013, 56.5% of the men who are out of the labor force reported receiving benefits from at least 1 disability program."
- 39:48: "Something like 1/8 adult men in our country are not behind bars has a felony conviction in their history."

## Ch 3: National Income

*General equilibrium model*

**Conclusions**

- **Factor prices** equilibrate factor markets
  - Firm demands each factor until MP = real factor price
- **Interest rate** equilibrates demand for g&s

**Assumptions:**

- Doesn't account for money or international trade
- Labor force is fully employed
- Capital, labor, and technology are fixed
- Ignore sticky short-run prices

**Math**:

- $Y = C(Y-T) + I(r) + G$
- "The demand for the economy’s output comes from consumption, investment, and government purchases. Consumption depends on disposable income, investment depends on the real interest rate, and government purchases and taxes are the exogenous variables set by fiscal policymakers"

---

## Ch 4: Monetary Policy

The main way in which the Fed controls the supply of money is through *Open-market operations:*

Money

- **Currency**: outstanding paper and coins
- M1, M2
- Credit cards are not included

![image-20211206135547061](/Users/Sam/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20211206135547061.png)

**Model**: pg 140

- B = monetary base, directly controlled by Fed
- r = reserve deposit ratio = at least 10% for now
- c = currency deposit ratio = people's currency divided by demand deposits

M = Money Supply = $B * \frac{r + 1}{r + c}$

- The fraction is also called $m$ or the **money multiplier**

### Fed Actions

pg 142 - Changing the Monetary Base $B$

Open market operations

- Increase by buying government bonds from the public
- Increase by lending reserves
  - Increase by lowering interest rates
  - Pay interest on excess reserves

---

## Ch 5: Inflation

**Quantity Theory of Money**

Money * Velocity = Price * Output

- (Y) Output: Real GDP
- (P) Price: Typical price of a transaction
- (M) Money: Quantity of money
- (V) Velocity: # of times money changes hands

Economy’s level of prices: (Assume velocity is fixed)

1. Production & production function determine Output
2. Money supply (central bank) determines nominal value of Price * Output.
3. Price level: $\frac{Price\: *\: Output}{Output}$
   1. Price level depends on today's money supply and expected future money supply

Govts raise money by:

- Taxes
- Borrow from public by selling govt bonds
- Print money (inflation tax)
  - Typically accounts for <3% of govt revenue in US

**Fisher Equation**:

Nominal interest rate = real interest rate + inflation rate

1% increase in money growth rate

--> 1% increase in inflation rate

--> 1% increase in nominal interest rate (3 month T-bills)

[Image](https://i.imgur.com/D4YkOGR.png)

Level of real money balances depends on the expected rate of inflation

*The price level depends on a weighted average of the current money supply and the money supply expected to prevail in the future. Inflation is driven by both current growth in the money supply and its expected future growth* (pg 167)

pg 460: The sticky-price model says that the deviation of output from the natural level is positively associated with the deviation of the price level from the expected price level.

## Ch 6: Economy in Long Run

[Image: Exports and Imports share of GDP for US and others](https://i.imgur.com/EcN41Zj.png)

### 6.1 Measurement

South Korea increased investment which led to a trade deficit (borrowing from abroad). This was not a problem for them because the returns from their investment were better than what they gave up.

- National Savings (S) = Public + Private Saving

- National Savings (S) = (T - G) + (Y - T - C)

- National Savings (S) = Y - C - G

- National Savings (S) = I + NX

- When NX is **negative**, we are running a **deficit**.

- This means that foreigners are lending to us & obtaining the claim to future returns on domestic capital.

### 6.2 Small open economy

Scenario Keys:  

- S = Y - C - G
- Low world savings --> high world interest rate --> low investment
- NX = S - I
- Low NX --> high real exchange rate (ie  dollar)

Scenarios: (pg 193)

- US increases G spending (assume small open economy)
- Foreign countries increase G (assume they are large enough to be large open economy)
- Scenario: US increases investment (assume small open economy)

| Metric               | US inc G            | World inc G  | US inc I   |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| World savings:       | -                   | $\downarrow$ | -          |
| World interest rate: | -                   | $\uparrow$   | -          |
| US investment:       | -                   | $\downarrow$ | $\uparrow$ |
| US savings:          | $\downarrow$        | -            | -          |
| US capital:          | Inflow              | Outflow      | Inflow     |
| US trade:            | Deficit             | Surplus      | Deficit    |
| Exchange Rate:       | $\uparrow$ (Strong) | Weak         | Strong     |

### 6.3 Exchange Rates

The **exchange rate** between two countries is the price at which residents of those countries trade with each other. When people refer to “the exchange rate” between two countries, they usually mean the nominal exchange rate.

- Higher exchange rate = Appreciation = Stronger US Dollar

  1 dollar = 100 yen ---> 1 dollar = 110

Protection policies: "We are importing too much, we need to protect domestic companies."

1. Lowers imports (ie shifts NX schedule outwards)
2. Increases demand & price for domestic goods (ie raises the exchange rate)
3. Foreigners buy less from US (ie lower exports, leaves NX unchanged)

Savings and investments are what determine NX.

If the dollar becomes too strong: Foreign countries cannot afford to buy products from us. This leads to a decrease in demand for US companies and ultimately layoffs and in increase in the unemployment rate.

If the dollar becomes too weak: People get to keep their jobs, but excess demand causes prices to go up (inflation).

Nominal: Relative price of **currency**

- 1 dollar = 100 yen. If this becomes 1 dollar = 110 yen, the dollar has appreciated (aka strengthened) in value.

Real: Relative price of **goods**

- Ex: Japanese car is 2x as expensive
- Real Exchange Rate = $\frac{(\text{100 Yen per Dollar}) \:\:*\:\: \text{(30k dollars per American Car)}}{\text{6M Yen per Japanese Car}}$
- Real Exchange Rate = $\text{Real Exchange Rate} * \text{Ratio of Price Levels}$
- If real exchange for the US is **high**, foreign goods are **cheap**. We will import lots of goods from abroad.

$\text{\% Chg in Nom Ex Rate}$ = $\text{\% Chg in Real Ex Rate}$ + $\text{Diff in Info Rates}$

## Ch 10: Short Run Intro

Long-run GDP growth is determined by technological progress.

Short-run GDP change is strongly correlated with the utilization of the economy’s labor force.

Business cycle: short run flucations of output & employment

- Peak: Start date
- Trough: End date

When the economy heads into a recession:

- C: Consumption goes down
- I: Investment goes down even more (business equipment, structures, new housing, and inventories)
- Unemployment goes up
  - Okun: $\text{\% Chg in Real GDP = 3\% - 2 * Chg in Unemp Rate}$

### Leading indicators

**USSLIND:** Leading Index for the United States

Employment:

- **AWHAEMAN**: Average weekly hours in manufacturing

  A longer workweek indicates that firms are asking their employees to work long hours because they are experiencing strong demand

- **ICSA**: Average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance

  This series is inverted in computing the index of leading indicators so that an increase in the series lowers the index.

New Orders

- **ACDGNO**: Manufacturers’ new orders for consumer goods and materials

  Direct measure of the demand for consumer goods that firms are experiencing. Because an increase in orders depletes a firm’s inventories, this statistic typically predicts subsequent increases in production and employment

- **NEWORDER**: Manufacturers’ new orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft.

  This series is the counterpart to the previous one, but for investment goods rather than consumer goods. When firms experience increased orders, they ramp up production and employment

- **ISM/MAN_NEWORDERS:** ISM new orders index

  Number of companies reporting increased orders minus the number reporting decreased orders. Unlike the previous two indicators, this one measures the proportion of companies that report rising orders and thus shows whether a change is broadly based.

- **PERMIT**: Building permits for new private housing units

  An increase in building permits means that planned construction is increasing, which indicates a rise in overall economic activity

- Index of stock prices

- Leading Credit Index: https://data-central.conference-board.org/

  Composite of six financial indicators.

- **T10YFFM**, **T10YFF**: Interest rate spread: the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds minus the federal funds rate.

  This spread, sometimes called the slope of the yield curve, reflects the market’s expectation about future interest rates, which in turn reflect the condition of the economy. A large spread means that interest rates are expected to rise, which typically occurs when economic activity increases

- **UMCSENT**: Consumer expectations for business and economic conditions

  Greater optimism about future economic conditions among consumers increases consumer demand for goods and services, suggesting that businesses will expand production and employment to meet the demand.

### 10.2 Time Horizons

In the short run, many prices are “sticky” at some predetermined level.

**Classical dichotomy**: theoretical separation of real and nominal variables
**Monetary neutrality:** irrelevance of the money supply for the determination of real variables

Scenario: 5% reduction in the money supply

|            | Long-Run | short-run |
| ---------- | -------- | --------- |
| Prices     | 5% drop  | -         |
| Output     | -        |           |
| Employment | -        |           |

Why sticky prices? Study by Alan Blinder, 1994

- **Coordination failure**: Firms hold back on price changes, waiting for others to go first
- **Cost-based pricing with lags**: Price increases are delayed until costs rise
- **Delivery lags, service**: Firms prefer to vary other product attributes, such as delivery lags, service, and product quality

### Model of Agg Supply & Demand

Long run:

- Output depends on ability to supply G&S
- Supply G&S depends on K, L, and available production technology
- Prices adjust until output demanded equals the quantity supplied

Short run:

- Output also depends demand for G&S
- Demand depends on consumers confidence, firm confidence, monetary & fiscal policy, etc

---

**3. Agg Demand**

Long Run Quantity Theory from Ch 5: $\text{MV = PY}$

$\text{Money Supply * Velocity of Money = Price Level * Output}$

![image-20211206135539817](/Users/Sam/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20211206135539817.png)

If the fed **reduces** the Money Supply (M), the aggregate demand curve shifts **inwards**.

**4. Agg Supply**

"Over long periods of time, prices are flexible, the aggregate supply curve is vertical, and changes in aggregate demand affect the price level but not output. Over short periods of time, prices are sticky, the aggregate supply curve is flat, and changes in aggregate demand do affect the economy’s output of goods and services."

"By itself, the aggregate demand curve does not tell us the price level or the amount of output that will prevail in the economy; it merely shows a relationship between these two variables. To accompany the aggregate demand curve, we need another relationship between P and Y that crosses the aggregate demand curve—an aggregate supply curve. The aggregate demand and aggregate supply curves together pin down the economy’s price level and quantity of output."

"In the long run, output is determined by the amounts of capital and labor and by the available technology; it does not depend on the price level. Therefore, the long-run aggregate supply curve, LRAS, is vertical."

Short run: "A reduction in the money supply shifts the aggregate demand curve downward, from AD to AD . The equilibrium for the economy moves from point A to point B. Because the aggregate supply curve is horizontal in the short run, the reduction in aggregate demand reduces output."

Case Study, France in 1724.

- Coin didn't indicate a specific dollar value, instead could be set by the government.
- One night, the govt reduced value of all coins by 20%. Over several months, reduced by 45%
- Initially, real wages rose
- Money became more valuable so interest rates rose

[Problems with too much inflation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iocaqkMGbHQ)

- Higher impact on low-income people
- Real incomes fall
- Higher prices = more expensive for foreign countries

## Ch 11: Agg Demand 1

IS, LM = Investment and saving, liquidity and money

- "Interactions between the goods and money markets determine the position and slope of the aggregate demand curve and, therefore, the level of national income in the short run"

**IS Curve**: relationship between the interest rate and the level of income that arises in the market for goods and services

[Keynesian Cross: Actual and Planned Expenditure](https://i.imgur.com/ivRfN9E.png)

When actual is too high = unplanned investments in inventory, workers are laid off, production is cut

### Ch 2

Malthusian Model Assumptions:

1. **Birth rate:** Each society has a birth rate determines by fertility factors
2. **Death rate:** When living standards go up, death rate goes down
3. **Material living standards:** When population goes up, living standards go down

Improvement in technology (This is due to the "constraints of nature" before the Industrial Revolution)

1. Increase in real incomes -->
2. Reduction in death rate -->
3. Increase in birth rate -->
4. Population growth -->
5. Real incomes return to the Malthusian Equilibrium. No lasting gain in living standards, only population growth.

### Ch 9: Modern Growth

The Industrial part of the label is, however, unfortunate and misleading. It was conferred mainly because the most observable component of many changes in England was the enormous growth of the industrial sector: cotton mills, potteries, foundries, steel works. Most Malthusian economies had 70 or even 80 percent of the population employed in agriculture. By 1861 that share was 21 percent in England. But that switch to industry, as we shall see, owed to the idiosyncracies of England’s geography and demography.

In pre-industrial economies farmers were 50 to 80 percent of the population. Now if we had a free market in food, two percent of the population could feed everyone. The farm population share in the USA for example, is 2.1 percent. Half of these people are kept in farming by government subsidies futilely trying to stem the inexorable exodus from the land and from rural communities. A mountain of EU subsidies keeps 3.3 percent of the French in their beloved Champagne. The less sentimental British, with a much more efficient agricultural system, employ only 1.8 percent in farming. The Industrial Revolution looks peculiarly industrial largely because of the switch of population and production out of agriculture and into industry created by higher incomes.

Fundamental equation of growth: The simple model collapses the immense complexity of all economies down to just five summary variables. In this picture of the economy it is a giant machine that receives inputs of physical capital, labor and land and turns them into a single sausage-like output, with A indexing how much output is received per unit of input. Then we need to specify how these quantities are related. And here again we find that despite the huge variety of economies, there is a simple relationship that holds for all time and all places.

$g_y = ag_k + cg_z + g_a$

- "g" meaning growth rates
- output Y,
- labor L,
- physical capital K,
- land Z
- level of efficiency A.

Thus despite all the complexities of economies since the Industrial Revolution, the persistent growth we have witnessed since 1800 can be the result of only two changes.

1. More capital per worker (1/4)
2. Greater efficiency of the production process (3/4)

# Timeline

[Wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/History_of_economic_thought)

## Ancient (before 500 AD)

**Hesiod/Homer** (750-650): Fundamental economic problem: Scarce resources, abundant desires.

**Plato** (428-348): Ideal city-state run by philosopher-kings, specialization of labor. Argued collective ownership was necessary to promote common pursuit & avoid social divisiveness.

**Aristotle** (384-322): Advocated holding many things in common, but argued that not everything could be due to "wickedness of human nature". Believed property should be private, but the use of it common.  For him there is a certain "art of acquisition" or "wealth-getting", which is necessary and honourable for one's household. However, exchange for simply accumulation is dishonorable. (Refers to Midas - turns everything into gold.)

## Middle Ages (500–1500)

**Feudalism** (800-1500): A way of structuring society around relationships derived from the holding of land in exchange for labour (and military protection).

> A broader definition of feudalism, as described by Marc Bloch (1939), includes not only the obligations of the warrior nobility but the obligations of all three estates of the realm: the **nobility**, the **clergy**, and the **peasantry**, all of whom were bound by a system of manorialism; this is sometimes referred to as a "feudal society".

**Thomas Aquinas** (1225–1274): Catholic, believed the concept of a "just" price was necessary for social order. (Similar to modern concept of long-run equilibrium.)

**Duns Scotus** (1265–1308): Scottish, believed merchants perform a necessary role by transporting goods and making them available to the public.

**Jean Buridan** (1300–1358) was a French priest. Aggregate supply & demand determine market prices. Hence, a "just" price was what the society collectively is willing to pay.

**Ibn Khaldun** (1332-1406) Arab Muslim scholar. Expressed a theory of the lifecycle of civilizations, the specialization of labor, and the value of money as a means of exchange rather than as a store of inherent value. Inspired the supply-side economics' **Laffer curve**, which posits that beyond a certain point higher taxes discourage production and actually cause revenues to fall.

**Saint Antoninus of Florence** (1389–1459) Italian Dominican friar / Archbishop of Florence.
State has an obligation to help the poor and needy and also has a duty to intervene in markets for the common good. Concerned about price, justice and capital theory.

## Mercantilism / Trade (1500-1800)

**Intro**: Following Christopher Columbus / exploration into Asia, newly-powerful **monarchies** wanted a more powerful military state to boost their status.

> Mercantilism was a political movement and an economic theory that advocated the use of the state's military power to ensure that local markets and supply sources were protected, spawning **protectionism**.

> Mercantile theorists held that international trade could not benefit all countries at the same time. Money and precious metals were the only source of riches in their view, and limited resources must be allocated between countries, therefore tariffs should be used to encourage exports, which bring money into the country, and discourage imports which send it abroad. In other words, a positive balance of trade ought to be maintained through a surplus of exports, often backed by military might. Despite the prevalence of the model, the term **mercantilism** was not coined until 1763 and popularized by Adam Smith in 1776, who vigorously opposed it.

**Sir Thomas More** (1478–1535) English. Argued for land being owned in common, universal education, and religious tolerance.

**Nicolaus Copernicus** (1473–1543) Polish. Published the first known argument for the quantity theory of money. Also published 1st form of Gresham's Law: "Bad money drives out good".

**Jean Bodin** (1530–1596) French. First known analysis of inflation, which he claimed was caused by importation of gold/silver from South America, backing the quantity theory of money.

**Barthélemy de Laffemas** (1545–1612) French mercantilist. First known mention of underconsumption theory, which was later refined by John Maynard Keynes.

**Thomas Mun** (1571–1641) English. A member of the **East India Company**.

- The company gained control of large parts of the Indian subcontinent and colonised parts of Southeast Asia and Hong Kong.
- Army totaled ~260k soldiers, twice the size of the British army at the time.
- Rose to account for half of the world's trade during the mid-1700s and early 1800s
- Initiated the beginnings of the British Empire in India. By 1858, most of modern India/Pakistan/Bangladesh was either ruled by the company or closely tied to it by treaty

**Sir William Petty** (1623–1687) English. Published short works applying the **rational scientific tradition** of Francis Bacon to economics, requiring that it only use measurable phenomena and seek quantitative precision, coining the term "political arithmetic", introducing statistical mathematics, and becoming the first scientific economist.

**Jean-Baptiste Colbert** (1619–1683) French minister of finance. Set up national guilds to regulate major industries (eg silk, linen, tapestry, furniture manufacture and wine). Each required membership until the **French Revolution** (1789-1799).

- **Causes**: Combo of social/political/economic
- **1789**: Financial crisis + social distress led to the "Storming of the Bastille", leading to the abolition of feudalism.
- **1792**: Following political struggle + economic depression, the monarchy was abolished and replaced by the French First Republic.
- **1793**: Another revolt leads to suspension of the constitution.
- **1799**: Napolean (leader of the Consulate) seizes power.

**Charles Davenant** (1656–1714) British. Published Essay on the East India Trade, displaying the first understanding of **consumer demand** and **perfect competition**.

**Aurangzeb** (1658-1707), Emperor of the Mughal India.
Compiled the sharia-based **Fatawa-e-Alamgiri** along several Muslim scholars which include **Islamic** economics, whose policies eventually led to the period of Proto-industrialization. It lasted as South Asia's principal regulating body until the beginning of the 18th century.

## Pre-Classical (1600-1800)

British Enlightenment

- 1600's: "Glorious Revolution": Power switch from Catholics to Protestants
  - Scientific advances (Isaac Newton - laws of motion, gravitation)
  - Economic advances (Richard Cantillon - applied )

**Richard Cantillon** (1680–1734)

> Consciously imitated Newton's forces of inertia and gravity in the natural world with human reason and market competition in the economic world. In his Essay on the Nature of Commerce in General, he argued rational self-interest in a system of freely-adjusting markets would lead to order and mutually-compatible prices. Unlike the mercantilist thinkers however, wealth was found not in trade but in human labor. The first person to tie these ideas into a political framework was **John Locke**.

**John Locke** (1632–1704), English, commonly known as the "**father of liberalism**".

> He is considered one of the most significant philosophers of his era mainly for his critique of Thomas Hobbes' defense of absolutism in Leviathan (1651) and of his social contract theory.

> Locke believed that people contracted into society, which was bound to protect their property rights. He defined property broadly to include people's lives and liberties, as well as their wealth. When people combined their labor with their surroundings, that created property rights.

**Dudley North** (1641–1691) Enlish Merchant, against Mercantilism.
Don't need a favorable balance of trade. Trade benefits everyone, promotes specialization, division of labor and wealth for everyone. Regulation interferes with these benefits.

**David Hume** (1711–1776) Scottish, against Mercantilism.
Agreed with North that we don't need a favorable balance of trade.
--> Export surplus paid for by gold/silver imports
--> Money supply increases
--> Prices rise
--> Decline in exports
--> Return to equilibrium

**Bernard Mandeville** (1670–1733), Anglo-Dutch philosopher.
Virtue = intentional actions that help others (overcoming our selfish nature).
This harms our society because the "vices" we purchase stimulate the economy.

**Physiocracy** (1700s), French - from the Greek for "government of nature".
The wealth of nations derives solely from the value of "land agriculture", and that agricultural products should be highly priced.
Did not have a positive impact on society.

## Classical (1700-1900)

**Ferdinando Galiani** (1728 - 1787), Italian.

> In 1751, Neapolitan philosopher Ferdinando Galiani published a nearly exhaustive treatise on money called Della Moneta (On Money), 25 years before Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, and therefore is seen as possibly the first truly modern economic analysis.
>
> In its five sections, Della Moneta covered all modern aspects of monetary theory, including the value and origin of money, its regulation, and inflation. This text remained cited by various economists for centuries, as wide-ranging a list as **Karl Marx** and Austrian economist **Joseph Schumpeter**.

#### **Adam Smith** (1723–1790), Scottish.
*Wealth of Nations* (1776) coincided with the American Revolution and the Industrial Revolution.

"System of natural liberty" --> individual effort (even selfish) was the producer of social good when acting in a competitive market.

Following John Locke, Smith thought true value of things derived from the amount of labour invested in them. (No longer followed - Karl Marx argued against this idea, prompting neo-classical economists to address it.)

3 functions of governement:

1. Maintain infrastructure / institutions
2. Prevent cartels
3. Prevent monopolies

---

[Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Adam-Smith)

The Theory of Moral Sentiments

- 1st book - sets foundation for Wealth of Nations
- Outlines principles of human nature, which Smith viewed as universal/unchanging
- Major question | what is the source of our ability to form **moral** judgements? (especially when contrasting **self-interest**)
  - Smith's answer | There's an “inner man” within us who plays the role of the “impartial spectator”, approving/condemning actions.
    Humans are (1) driven by passions/self-interest and (2) self-regulated by our ability to reason & capacity for sympathy.
    This duality (1) pits us against one another and (2) provides the motivation turn this to the common good.

**William Pitt** (1759–1806), British, Prime Minister of the UK.
Advocated Smith's proposals successfully.

**Jeremy Bentham** (1748-1832), British philosopher.
Developed utilitarianism.

> Bentham was an atheist, a prison reformer, animal rights activist, believer in universal suffrage, freedom of speech, free trade and health insurance at a time when few dared to argue for any of these ideas.

**Jean-Baptiste Say** (1767–1832), French.
(Popular until Great Depressions) **Say's Law of markets**: There can never be a general deficiency of demand of commodities in the economy. People produce things to fulfill their own wants. Therefore, production is not a question of supply, but an indication of producers' demand.

**David Ricardo** (1772–1823), British.
Ricardo made a distinction between workers, who received a wage fixed to a level at which they could survive, the landowners, who earn a rent, and capitalists, who own capital and receive a profit, a residual part of the income.

If population grows, it becomes necessary to cultivate additional land, whose fertility is lower than that of already cultivated fields, because of the law of decreasing productivity. Therefore, the cost of the production of the wheat increases, as well as the price of the wheat: The rents increase also, the wages, indexed to inflation (because they must allow workers to survive) as well. Profits decrease, until the capitalists can no longer invest. The economy, Ricardo concluded, is bound to tend towards a steady state.

**John Stuart Mill** (1806-1873), English.
Jeremy Bentham was a close mentor and family friend.
On economic growth - tried to find middle ground between
(1) Adam Smith's view of ever-expanding opportunities for trade / tech innovation
(2) Thomas Malthus' view of the inherent limits of population.

**Classical economists**
The classical economists were referred to as a group for the first time by Karl Marx.
At the time: Had witnessed Industrial Revolution (urbanization, wealth, inequality, demographic transition)

Thought about population growth, the source of value, the causes of economic growth, the role of money in the economy.
Favored *labor theory of value* instead of the *general equilibrium theory of s&d*.
Supported a free-market economy, but were divided on specifics.

One notable group (Malthus) favored **underconsumption theory**. Argued for governement to mitigate unemployment & economic downturn. Predecessor for **Keynesian economics** in the 1930s.

**Karl Marx** (1818-1883), German.

Begins with "commodities" as focal point. (Commodity = raw material + labor)
Commodities have a dual nature:

- use value
- exchange value

The common property is *human labor*.

(*Cyclical bust*) Unemployment goes up --> downward pressure on wages --> demand falls --> unsold products --> production cuts back --> profit declines --> economic depression.

Once the "unsold products" clear, there would be a boom until the next *cyclical bust*. With each boom & bust, tension would grow between capitalists & workers.

## Neoclassical (1800-1900)

Developed in the 1870s. The 3 independent schools:

1. **Cambridge School** (UK): Developed theories of partial equilibrium and focusing on market failures
2. **Austrian School**: Developed theory of capital and tried to explain economic crises.
3. **Lausanne School **(Swiss): Developed theories of general equilibrium and Pareto efficiency.

## Alternative schools (1800-1900)

## World Wars, Revolutions, Great Depression (1900s)

## Keynesianism (1900s)

## The Chicago school of economics (1900s)

## Games, evolution and growth (1900s)

## Post World War II and globalization (1900s)

# Globalization

[Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV3jPKHcHSE) - Peter Zeihan

End of WW2 - US wants trade partners. We say we'll patrol the ocean for everyone.

For the US to be engaged in the world:

1. Need global economic interests to engage
2. Need global military footprint to protect commerce
3. Need bipartisan agreement that the costs are worth it

US top 5: Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Japan, UK

Mexico especially for low to mid-skilled manufacturing

Katherine Tai (Taiwan)

- Top trade envoy
- Trade lawyer - has historically been very opposed to China

China 

- Does not like to import from the US
- Concerned that their financial sector is broken
- Concerned their export model won't work without the US

"While Confucianism typically focuses on ideals of harmony, hierarchy, and normative social order, geopolitics analyses geographical influences on politics – in particular, violence and conflict. However, it is precisely within this contradictory dialectic that new possibilities for analysing the geopolitics of a rising global power can emerge."

"Previous studies have analysed Chinese geopolitics through the lens of Communist geopolitics, placing Chinese geopolitics (both narratives and practices) in the binarism of communism-capitalism. Other studies have used nationalism as a lens to observe Chinese geopolitics. The nationalist approach explains Chinese geopolitics through a dichotomous framework of ‘Chineseness’ and ‘non-Chineseness’ in which patriotism and national identity (rather than the cultural identity of Confucianism) are regarded as the foundation for Chinese geopolitical visions."

BRI: These all reflect Confucian geopolitics’ pursuit of the ideal geopolitical order – ‘harmony in difference’ (i.e. seeking similarity without eradicating differences).

1. notions of mutual learning
2. complementarity (huxue, hujian, hubu)
3. community of humankind’s shared destiny (renlei mingyun gongtongti)

Confucianism: humaneness & harmony (humaneness for others, harmony and order [ren yi churen, hexie youxu])

- Tend to be weak in conflict

Hua and Yi

- ‘Hua’: Han Chinese, those having an agricultural or "civilised" economy, those spaces under the direct political impact of the central government, and, most importantly, spaces influenced by Confucian values. 
- ‘Yi’: ethnic minorities, those with a nomadic economy, those that are out of the reach of the central government, and those that push back against Confucian doctrines





## Trade War

Harvard: What does China import to the US?

- [Tree](https://i.imgur.com/KHmRe2X.png)
- [Over time](https://i.imgur.com/HosGl0F.png)

[NBER - ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE US-CHINA TRADE WAR](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29315/w29315.pdf)

The main takeaways from this research is that US consumers of imported goods have borne the brunt of the tariffs through higher prices, and that the trade war has lowered aggregate real income in both the US and China, although not by large magnitudes relative to GDP.

2018: US launches a trade war with China, an abrupt departure from its historical leadership in integrating global markets. 

By late 2019: 

- US had imposed tariffs on roughly \$350 billion of Chinese imports
- China had retaliated on \$100 billion US exports

Jan 2020: "Truce" signed

How tariffs could impact import prices:

- Incomplete pass-through (import prices **fall** after tariffs) 
- Complete passthrough (import prices rise one-for-one with the tariff changes): This one has been supported by evidence.

However, they also find that China’s retaliatory tariffs coincided with Republican-leaning counties, largely because these counties tend to be rural and the Chinese tariffs were large in agriculture. Blanchard et al. (2019) argue that the political consequences of the trade war did not pay off for the Republican party in 2018 Congressional election, as counties more exposed to the retaliatory tariffs reduced support for Republican candidates.

In 2017, China accounted for an average 23% of US imports, and the US accounted for an average 12% of Chinese imports

The complete pass-through in China reinforces the surprising nature of the results: in standard general equilibrium, if an importer faces an elastic export supply from an exporter, then that exporter would typically be able to manipulate the terms of trade using trade policy. But during the trade war, neither country seemed able to manipulate the terms of trade in its favor.



[Trade War Timeline](https://www.piie.com/sites/default/files/documents/trump-trade-war-timeline.pdf)

Biden Extends Trump-Era Solar Tariffs (February 4, 2022)

- The Biden administration extends Section 201 tariffs on imported solar panels and cells by four years with some modifications. “Bifacial” solar panels, which generate electricity on both sides and are often used in utility-scale solar projects, will be exempt, and the highest tariff rate will apply only to cells that generate more than 5 gigawatts of power per year, up from 2.5.

We impose tariffs on:

- Steel, aluminum, washing machines, solar panels

We face tariffs on:

- China: Sorghum, aluminum waste and scrap, pork, fruits and nuts
- Others: Agricultural / consumer goods. Specific items include bourbon whiskey, motor boats and yachts, motorcycles, blue jeans, corn, and peanut butter





How much oil is used for agriculture? Is this why demand was so low?

# Fed

## 2020 Report

[2020 Report](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2020-annual-report.pdf)

- Conducting monetary policy and monitoring economic developments.
- Promoting financial system stability.
- Supervising and regulating financial institutions and their activities
- Fostering payment and settlement system safety and efficiency
- Promoting consumer protection and community development.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has held its policy rate near zero and has continued to purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities to support the economic recovery

### Labor

While unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus and a relaxation of rigorous social-distancing restrictions supported a rapid rebound in the U.S. labor market last summer, the pace of gains has slowed and employment remains well below pre-pandemic levels. 

In addition, weak aggregate demand and low oil prices have held down consumer price inflation

### Inflation

In addition, weak aggregate demand and low oil prices have held down consumer price inflation.

Core inflation (ex food and energy)

Long-run objective of 2%.

After declining sharply as the pandemic struck, consumer price inflation rebounded along with economic activity, but inflation remains below pre-COVID levels and the FOMC’s longer-run objective of 2 percent.

### Financial conditions

The following actions continued to support the *flow of credit in the economy*

- Low interest rates
- Federal Reserve’s asset purchases
- Establishment of emergency lending facilities

In particular, the capitalization of U.S. global systemically important banks, or G-SIBs, exceeds pre-pandemic levels. 

Government programs—including expanded unemployment insurance and direct stimulus payments in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act—and a rebound in economic activity in the second half of 2020 reduced economic hardship for households and mitigated the deterioration in household credit quality.

Some businesses and households have become more vulnerable to shocks, as *earnings have fallen* and *borrowing has risen*

Financial institutions, however, may experience additional losses as a result of rising defaults in the coming years, and long-standing vulnerabilities at money market mutual funds and open-end investment funds remain unaddressed

## Consumer Credit

https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/about.htm

G.19 Statistical Release "Consumer Credit" 

- Outstanding credit extended to individuals for household, family, and other personal expenditures, excluding loans secured by real estate.
- Two types
  - **Revolving**: borrow up to a prearranged limit and repay the debt. Credit card loans comprise most of revolving consumer credit measured
  - **Nonrevolving**: closed-ended, pay it off once and you're done. Consumer motor vehicle and education loans comprise the majority of nonrevolving credit
- Three types
  - Outstanding
  - Outstanding levels
  - Outstanding flows

Pg 178 / 165

In classic economics the interrelations in production are vital to understand the laws of production and distribution, and therefore to understand how an economic system works. Wassily Leontief, a Russian born American economist made the greatest contribution in this line of thought by developing the input/output analysis.

In order to explore this idea in a simple way consider an economy consisting three activities: coal mining, electricity generation and truck production. Outputs of these activities are used in the production of others and are also demanded for final use, i.e. consumption and/or investment.

The description of production activity through such input-output relations delineates following points: 

- (a) Production of a commodity requires the use of other commodities as inputs. But as was the case above, a production activity need not use all the commodities available in the system. (Coal was not an input in truck production) 
- (b) A commodity may also be demanded as a final product. In the example above coal is demanded for heating. Again this may not be true for all commodities. Trucks may be used only for commercial purposes, and not as family cars

## Airbnb - Similar Problem

[Optimal Pricing](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/learning-market-dynamics-for-optimal-pricing-97cffbcc53e3?jr=on)

We embrace both machine learning (ML) and structural modeling.

Lead time

- This booking process reflects the inflow of demand and can be treated as a stochastic ***arrival process\***. The corresponding distribution of bookings over lead time is the booking ***lead time distribution\***.
- [Lead Time Distribution](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*laQ8afu4aUvB4Ogj)
- Goal: estimate density for each listing + check-in date + every lead day

1. **Clusters**: The listings within a cluster share common demand profiles and have similar lead time distributions.
2. **Structural Modeling**: We can explicitly model the relationship between booking density and lead time by assuming the lead time distribution per cluster to be Gamma with unknown parameters *⍺, β.*

## Constrained Optimization

- Storage cost = $8k per tonne
- Initial stock = 100 tonnes
- Ending stock = needs to be 100 tonnes
- Small trucks
  - Cost = $700k
  - Capacity = 500 tonnes
- Large trucks
  - Cost = $1,400k
  - Capacity = 1,200 tonnes

![](https://i.imgur.com/QN2EBSO.png)

- $q$ = tonnes to produce
- $s$ = tonnes to stock at end of each month
- $t$ = number of small trucks
- $u$ = number of large trucks



Step 1: Define decision variables and quantity to be optimized as a mathematical function.

$Obj: Min \: Z = \sum c_i * q_i + 8s_i + 700k_i + 1400u_i$



Step 2: Define constraints mathematically. In this case, the constraints are our demand.

- For the following 4 quarters: Last quarter stock + quantity we produce = demand + ending stock

- (Demand)  |  $s_{i-1} + q_i = d_i+ s_i$

- (Demand re-written)  |  $s_{i-1} + q_i  - s_1 = d_i$

- (Starting)   |   $s_0 = 100$

- (Ending)     |   $s_4 = 100$

  

Step 3: Express hidden conditions (eg can't be negative, has to be integer, etc)

- (Trucks)      |   $q_i \leq 500t_i + 1200u_i$

- (Min production))  |  $q_1, q_2, q_3, q_4 \geq 0$

- (Storage non-negative)  |  $s_i \geq 0$

  

```
/* Objective function */
min:20 q1 + 25 q2 + 30 q3 + 40 q4 + 8 s1 + 8 s2 + 8 s3 + 8 s4 + 700 t1 + 700 t2 + 700 t3 + 700 t4 + 1400 u1 + 1400 u2 + 1400 u3 + 1400 u4 ;


/* Variable bounds */
s0 = 100;
s0 + q1 - s1 = 1000;

# Futures

## Shiller

[Lecture](https://oyc.yale.edu/economics/econ-252-11/lecture-15)

Contango vs Backwardation

- Contango: Price curve going up for future dates
- Backwardation: Price curve going down
  - Why? Storage costs are too high. Only the people who prioritize convenience will store

**Futures markets**: Standardized contracts, representing future events

**Counter Party Risk**: Futures markets get rid of counterparty risk because parties make a contract with the exchange (guarentee function). The broker also takes no risk because they'll close you out when your margin is depleted. As a result, prices are *pure* prices.

Sellers want the price to go down after the contract is made



**Fair Value**: "You have to think of futures markets as storage markets."

$P_{future} = (1+r+s) * P_{spot}$

- $r$: Interest rate between now and then (%)
- $s$: Storage cost (%)

## Chapter

Book: Fabozzi, Foundations of Financial Markets
Ch. 26: [Financial Futures Markets](file:///Users/Sam/Library/Mobile%20Documents/iCloud~com~apple~iBooks/Documents/Econ/Ch%2026%20Futures.pdf)

Basic economic function of futures: Hedge against risk & volatility

Futures

- **Commodity**: agriculture, food, industrial
- **Financial**: stocks, interest rates, currencies

Derivatives: underlying instrument  -->  contract value

$\text{Degree of Leverage} = \frac{1}{Margin \: Rate}$

**Daily price limits**: The excahnge can impose a limit on price movement up or down. Trading does not stop, but rather continues with the min/max limits.

Forward contracts are intended for delivery. With futures contracts, <2% are settled by delivery.



**Contracts**

- Long: Buyer      |      Short: Seller
- Price
- Delivery date
  - Closest: "nearby"      |     farthest: "distant" or "deferred"

**Liquidate**

- Buyers liquidate by selling same \# of contracts
- **Open interest**: \# of contracts entered but not yet liquidated



**Margin**

- **Initial**: required deposit for the contract
- **Maintenance**: Min level your **equity** can fall. If you fall below, need to add additional "variation" margin to return to the initial level.
  - **Equity**: Sum of initial margin + total gains - total losses

Settlement price at EOD: Determined by the exchange. Could be the close price, could be the median or average of trades towards EOD.

# Dalio Econ Machine

3 main forces drive the economy

1. Productivity Growth
2. Short-Term Debt Cycle  |  5-8 years
3. Long-Term Debt Cycle   |  75-100 years

Total spending = money + *credit*

Government: Largest player

- **Central Government**: Collect taxes & spend money
- **Central Bank**: Controls amount of money & credit
  - Influence interest rates
  - Print new money

Productivity drives long-run growth, debt sets the short-term swings (business cycle)

- Total credit in US: $50T
- Total money in US: $3T



## Short-Term Debt Cycle 

(12:00)

Credit growth
--> Economic activity increases 
--> Spending Increases
--> **Expansion**
--> Inflation
--> Fed raises interest rates
--> Less borrowing
--> Spending slows
--> **Recession**
--> Deflation
--> Fed lowers interest rates

## Long-Term Debt Cycle 

(14:30)

Over long periods of time, debts tend to rise faster than incomes. Nevertheless, lenders see the short-term growth and continue to lend. Debt rise, incomes rise, asset values rise, people feel wealthy. Eventually, we reach a point where debt repayments grow faster than income which forces people to cut back on their spending. This is the **Long-Term Debt Peak**. In 2008, the US debt-to-GDP ratio reached ~400%.

In response, the economy begins deleveraging. Same recession cycle as before, except interest rates fall so low that the Fed can no longer lower them anymore. In 2008, US Short Term Interest Rate fell to 0%.



## Solution to Deleveraging

(19:10)

**Deflationary**: Bring down debt burden

- Cut spending
- Reduce debt through defaults & restructures
- Redistribute wealth
- Print money



**Inflationary**: Both G need to cooperate.

- **Central Bank** needs to print money (buy G bonds) to lend money to the central government.
- **Central Government** then buys G&S through its stimulus plans & unemployment benefits. 

This is done by running a **deficit** which will need to be paid off. Even though this increases the G debt burden, it *should* lower the economies' total burden.

**Deflationary and inflationary ways need to be balanced.**

- If credit falls by 1B and you print 1B, there won't be inflation.
- (28:25) "However, printing money can easily be abused because its so easy to do. The key is to avoid printing too much money and causing unacceptable inflation, the way Germany did during its deleveraging in the 1920's."
- Reflation typically takes about ~10 years. (ie "Lost Decade")







# The Signal and the Noise

## Intro

1440: Printing press invented by Johannes Gutenberg. Sparking point for the industrial revolution in 1775.
---> Mass production makes books more affordable
---> Explosion in religious texts (eg Martin Luther)
---> Holy wars 

> The importance of the Industrial Revolution is hard to overstate. Throughout essentially all of human history, economic growth has proceeded at a rate of perhaps 0.1 percent per year, enough to allow for a very gradual growth in population size, but not any growth in per-capita living standards. (pg 6)

This ^ matches up with the Economic History section above.

---



**Productivity Paradox**

> Instead, the computer boom of the 1970s and 1980s produced a temporary **decline** in economic and scientific productivity. Economists termed this the economic paradox. "You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics," wrote the economist Robert Solow in 1987. (pg 7)

Productivity improved late on as we came to more realistic expectations of what technology could produce.

# Companies

1. **Understand the Business:**
   - Start by understanding the company's business model. What products or services do they offer? How do they generate revenue?
2. **Financial Statements:**
   - Review the company's financial statements, including the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. Look for trends, growth, and financial stability.
3. **Key Financial Ratios:**
   - Analyze important financial ratios such as Price-to-Earnings (P/E), Price-to-Sales (P/S), Return on Equity (ROE), and Debt-to-Equity ratio. These ratios provide insights into the company's financial health and valuation.
4. **Management and Leadership:**
   - Evaluate the management team. Look for their experience, track record, and their vision for the company's future. Check if they have a history of success in the industry.
5. **Competitive Analysis:**

### Overview

Time

- 1760: Steam engine (Industrial revolution)
- 1973: Oil price shock

Consumption = Production + Imports - Exports

Standards:

- **Price:** Dollars per Gigajoule
- **Cost:** Dollars per Kilowat of capacity

Since 1850:

- 5x: Population
- 4x: Per capita energy use

Why?

- Access to fossil fuels = more people can survive
- Social change * population growth = innovation

Carbon-free electricy generating sources: 

- Hydro
- Nuclear
- Wind
- Solar
- [Image: Growth rates](https://i.imgur.com/7zxCIsc.png)
- [Image: Market Share](https://i.imgur.com/dr8Y43a.png)

US 2004-2014 Avg Cost (per GJ): [2nd Video](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+ENGSCI137x+2T2021/block-v1:HarvardX+ENGSCI137x+2T2021+type@sequential+block@0fd919870e0b4ebea749f56c96b619d3/block-v1:HarvardX+ENGSCI137x+2T2021+type@vertical+block@28cc621966684f39862142669bb7f96f)

- $20: Electricity
  - High price because expensive to turn coal into electricity
  - Electricity not used for heating because its so expensive compared to gas
  - Oil used to be used, but its more expensive than gas & nuclear
- $14: Oil
- $6: Gas
- $2: Coal



Oil vs Gas:

- Transportation: Oil is a much better transportation fuel than natural gas. Its cheaper & more efficient
- When producing oil, you also get some natural gas. 
- Oil can be sent internationally easily. Gas cannot.
- *Natural gas prices move as a result of the oil market*



### Costs

Costs

- **Levelized Cost**: Fixed cost + variable costs

  [Calculator](https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/tech-lcoe.html)

- **Cost of mitigation**: Includes business & environmental costs

Solar & wind: high fixed up front, low variable



### Ideas

Primary sources --> Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Transportation

- If you see how the "outputs" are changing, you'll be able to track the inputs
- Where are these inputs located globally? This is where the war is fought
- How much does it cost?
- Europe needs heat: does it need to come from natural gas? Which countries / companies supplies Europe with natural gas?

### US

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) develops the AEO by using the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS), an integrated model that captures interactions of economic changes and energy supply, demand, and prices.

### History

Major developments

- Hybridization (seed improvement)
- Mechanization of farming
- Intensive farming

---> Colonies spread west
---> Grow wheat in cooler regions
---> Pre canals/railroads: Hard to get wheat to market
	---> Raise hogs, grow corn to feed hogs
---> "Wheat frontier" passes through, diversified farms (think dairy cattle) take its place

Warmer regions
---> Cotton and beef cattle

1942
---> WW2
---> Need for fats, oils, and meal
---> Farmers encouraged to plant all possible land
---> US becomes world's largest **soybean** producer
---> 1969: US produces 76% of world soybeans

Between 1948 and 2015

- 4M farms disappear
- Total output > 2x
- Large farms (> 2k acres) growing, smaller ones declining

---

### Recent

Corn:

- Largest world producer by far, only China is starting to come close
- Mostly in Iowa and Illinois

Soybean:

- Was largest producer, Brazil took over in 2020

Wheat

- 4th largest producer behind China, India and Russia



### Crops

**Crops**

- **Cash crop**: grown to sell for profit

- **Staple crop** (subsistence crop): fed to livestock

- 63% of crop workers were born in Mexico + 5% born in Central America



## 03 | Change Drivers

### a. Supply

#### Costs of Production 

- Fertilizer natural gas is main source of hydrogen used to produce ammonia which is the base for all nitrogenous fertilizers
- Electricity 
- Fuel 
- Other petroleum-based products 
- "The main components of the fertilizer price index and the energy price index are the price of natural gas and the price of crude oil, respectively"

#### Harvest area & yield growth 

- Producers increase planted acreage in anticipation of greater crop returns. 
- Yield growth source: technical & farm practice changes

#### Stocks-to-use ratio 

- Ratio = supply of commodities / demand



### b. Demand

#### Economic growth rates

"The economic expansion in many countries produces an upward movement of the urban population into the middle class that can afford to consume high-valued livestock and convenient processed products."

Price hikes 

- changing consumption habits and diet diversification 
- expanding middle class 
- increasing urbanization 

Global 

- **China**: Prices fall as China rebalances from an export-oriented economy to a domestic-demand economy 
- **India**: Fastest growing economy (higher demand), but hasn't impacted prices much because they've become a major exporter 



#### Biofuel mandates

[AMPF](https://www.afpm.org/issues/fuels-vehicles/RFS)

Why? Fears of energy dependence, analysts were expecting:

- Increased fuel consumption 
- Decreasing domestic crude production 

Actual result 

- Gas demand flattened due to improved tech 

- Fracking enabled crude oil production to skyrocket 



#### Increased trading in futures markets 

"A typical feature of these commodity contracts is that only 2 percent of them end in the delivery of the physical commodity. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations asserted that excessive speculation amplified soaring agricultural commodity prices in 2007/08, with the claim being that speculation creates excessive demand and disconnects prices from supply-use balance."

---

### c. Policy

The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, also known as the 2018 Farm Act, is assumed to be in effect through the projection period.

Land enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is assumed to rise to 27 million acres by 2029—and through 2031—which is the maximum level legislated in the 2018 Farm Act.

Projections assume continuation of China tariff policies in effect in 2021. China imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products in 2018, but exclusions were granted for many of them in 2020. Tariffs after the expiration of the **Phase One agreement in 2022** are unknown. Tariffs on U.S. products do not necessarily affect China’s overall projected demand for imports since China has multiple suppliers for most commodities.

10-Year Baseline Abstract

> This report provides projections for the agricultural sector to 2032. Projections cover agricultural commodities, agricultural trade, and aggregate indicators of the sector, such as farm income. The projections are based on specific assumptions, including a macroeconomic scenario, existing U.S. policy, and current international agreements. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 is assumed to remain in effect through the projection period. The projections are one representative scenario for the agricultural sector and reflect a composite of model results and judgment-based analyses. The projections in this report were prepared using data through the October 2022 World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report, except where noted otherwise. Macroeconomic assumptions were concluded in August 2022.

### Crude Oil

#### History



- [What is crude oil?](https://www.thebalance.com/crude-oil-prices-trends-and-impact-on-the-economy-and-you-3305738)
- [Crude oil market](https://www.thebalance.com/crude-oil-brent-versus-wti-808872#:~:text=WTI%20is%20the%20benchmark%20crude%20for%20North%20America.&text=Brent%20crude%20oil%20futures%20trade,use%20them%20in%20different%20manners)

Crude oil: Not yet refined for use. Used for:

- Transportation
- Heating and electricity generation
- Petroleum products
- Plastics

Each barrel of crude oil = 19.4 gallons of gasoline

Crude oil prices: spot price of various barrels of oil. Common:

- West Texas Intermediate (US)
  - Little bit cheaper than Brent because of shale oil
- Brent Blend 
  - Benchmark for Africa, Europe, Middle East
  - Produced in the Brent oil fields and other sites in the North Sea
- Dubai Mercantile Exchange

WTI/Brent Factors:

- U.S. production levels
- Supply-and-demand balance in the U.S.
- North Sea production
- Geopolitical issues internationally

Arab Spring in Egypt 2011 --> Brent price went up. Fears of Suez Canal closure.

In late 2011, the Iranian government threatened to close the Straits of Hormuz, through which approximately 20% of the world's oil flows.

In 2019, domestic production met 60% of the U.S. demand of 20.46 million barrels per day.

#### Projections

Start --> Agricultural Baseline Projections --> Visualization: U.S. Agricultural Baseline Projections

> USDA agricultural projections are updated annually following the October release of USDA’s *World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates* (*WASDE*) report. 

> Total U.S. corn supply is expected to **grow 1.4 percent per year over the next decade**, with rising yields more than offsetting declining planted area. Under the scenario of continued economic growth and low inflation and unemployment in the United States., prices decline from \$5.70 per bushel in 2023/24 to \$4.30 by the end of the projection period. 
>
> Relative prices in the United States are expected to favor corn slightly. Domestic corn use grows at just under 1 percent per year for the projection period. 
>
> Corn-based ethanol production is projected to be mostly flat over the next 10 years, as declining overall gasoline consumption in the U.S. is essentially offset by growth in U.S. ethanol exports. U.S. corn exports are projected to grow about 2 percent per year over the baseline but with expectations of a slowly declining U.S. world trade share as a result of competition from Argentina and Brazil. Net returns decline throughout the projection period from previously elevated levels.



Report as of November 2022

2022-2032

- Supply growth: +1.4% per year
- Domestic Use:  +0.9% per year
- Price: \$5.70 --> \$4.30
- Less planted area, but higher yields more than offset



### Wheat



### Dairy

#### History

DataMark API: https://mpr.datamart.ams.usda.gov/menu.do?path=\Products\Cattle

- Fresh dairy products
  - Ice cream
  - Cottage cheese
- Processed products
  - Milk
  - Butter
  - Cheese
  - Skim milk powder 
  - Whole milk powder

“In low and middle-income countries, **fresh dairy products** comprise over two-thirds of the average per capita dairy consumption (milk solids), while consumers in high income countries tend toward **processed products**”

#### Projections

`7.1 Projection Highlights`

*Note: This is for the next 10 years & about dairy as a whole.*

3 major exporters

- New Zealand
- US
- EU

Supply increase, mostly from India/Pakistan

Demand increase, mostly due to China.

- “China is expected to remain the most important importer of milk products despite a slight increase in domestic milk production relative to the past decade.”

Demand increases as incomes rise.

- High income countries: +0.4% p.a.
- Mid/low income countries: 2.0% p.a.



“Consumption of cheese primarily occurs in Europe and North America, exhibiting a growing trend in both regions.”

“The projected increase in import demand for dairy products in Asian countries will be driven by economic and population growth and a shift towards livestock products.”

“Over the medium term, the European Union, New Zealand and the United States will remain the key exporters of processed dairy product and are projected to jointly account for around 65% of cheese, 71% of WMP, 74% of butter, and 80% of SMP exports in 2031.”

“To date, the big milk consuming countries, India and Pakistan, are largely self-sufficient with production growing in parallel with domestic consumption.”

“Over the coming decade, however, skim milk powder (SMP) is expected to record the highest consumption growth, although from a lower base.”

“Since 2015, the price of butter has been considerably higher than for SMP. This development is attributed to stronger demand for milk fat compared to other milk solids on the international market.”

“Sustainable production policies and consumer concerns expressed in the market could alter the projections for the dairy sector. In some countries, dairy production accounts for a substantial share of overall greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), resulting in discussions on how adjustments to dairy production could contribute to reducing such emissions.”

EU policies targeted to sustainable production 

---> Production in the EU expected to grow slower than in North America

`7.2 Market trends`

“The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the dairy sector was relatively modest, in contrast to the initial concerns that it was particularly vulnerable. ”

“In 2021 the FAO Dairy Price Index value increased by 17% with increases across all dairy products, with butter, SMP and WMP rising by 30%, 22% and 27%, respectively, while cheese recorded an 8.8% rise.”



### Livestock

#### History

Animals

- Broilers (chicken & turkey)
- Cows
- Pigs

Products

- Meat
- Dairy
- Eggs

#### Projections

Pg 7: Intro projections

> In the livestock sector, **meat**, **dairy**, and **egg** production all rise continuously throughout the projection period, with chicken, pork, egg, and dairy production all ending at record levels in 2032. Beef production starts the projection period (2024) after 2 years of cyclical herd rebuilding which lowers near-term projected beef production in 2022 and 2023. Note that for animals and animal products, the Baseline projection begins with calendar year 2024, while figures for calendar year 2022 and 2023 are based on published projections from the October 12, 2022 World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report. Beef production rises by 8 percent, pork by 11.9 percent, and chicken by 10.2 percent. Overall milk production rises by 9.6 percent and eggs by 7.9 percent. Turkey production growth is the slowest, at 4.4 percent.



Pg 56-71: U.S. Livestock Section

*Note*

- Beef cattle: Eat primarily grass, also some grain. Produce milk, but only for their calves.
- Dairy cattle: Eat forages (aka grasses) and grains.



Meat:

- red meat (beef, veal, pork, lamb, and mutton)
- poultry (broilers and turkey) 



Factors that shape 2024–32 livestock-poultry production estimates

- Modest real GDP growth
- Moderating prices of feed grains and oilseeds compared to recent history
- Drought conditions that began in late 2020



Production

- **Broilers** (Chicken & turkeys): Strong growth

- **Beef**: Decline in 23/24, increase after

  --> Drought --> reduced cattle --> beef production low rates of increase

  --> higher cattle prices --> higher heifer retention

- **Pork**: Strong growth, 1.4% YoY

- **Milk**: Expected growth



Demand (disappearance)

- **Broilers** (Chicken & turkeys): Strong growth
- **Beef**: Flat
- **Pork**: Increase



##### Price

Figure 22

**Cattle**: In 2022 and 2023, **steer prices in the 5-area marketing region** are forecast to rise reflecting tightening cattle supplies. As producers respond to higher cattle prices, U.S. cattle inventories are expected to expand in 2025, and cattle prices are projected to decline through 2026 to \$137.82 per hundredweight (cwt). For the remainder of the period, steer prices are expected to gradually rise to \$148.73 per cwt in 2032 reflecting strong global demand for U.S. beef and relatively tight supplies for the domestic market.

**Summary**:
---> **22/23**: Supply low (tight) due to drought
---> **22/23**: Price increase
---> **25**: Supply increase
---> **25/26**: Price decrease
---> **26-32**: Price increase steadily



**Pork**: Pork production grows moderately in the projection period. Hog prices—**national base lean prices for live-equivalent 51–52 percent lean hogs**—are expected to average about $54.80 per hundredweight. Strong processor demand for hogs—deriving primarily from robust domestic pork demand and moderate export demand—support hog prices over the projection period. Although comparatively high relative to history, hog prices are projected to remain substantially below elevated prices in 2021 and projected at still high levels through 2023. The initial jump in prices during 2021 reflected strong consumer demand for pork to be prepared at home. Prices through 2023 are also expected to be supported by constrained supplies. Prices after 2024 gradually decline as production grows through 2032 and competition with other meats increases.

The real exchange rate of the U.S. dollar is expected to depreciate fractionally against the currencies of agricultural trade partners during 2024–32.

- i.e., US products become cheaper for foreigners, US exports increase
