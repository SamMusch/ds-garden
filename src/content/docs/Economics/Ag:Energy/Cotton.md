> Upward trends in cotton consumption have occurred in Bangladesh and Vietnam, where companies are shifting their **manufacturing** to countries with relatively cheap labor, thereby increasing their demand for and consumption of raw cotton fiber. Turkey’s cotton mill use has also grown modestly. ([Link](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/cotton-wool/cotton-sector-at-a-glance/))

Top ten cotton-producing countries are India, China, the United States, Pakistan, Brazil, Australia, Uzbekistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Burkina Faso.

India, China, US, Brazil

- Top 2: 45% of global production
- Top 4: 75% of global production

**India**

- Yields are well below the global average
- Cotton area in India dwarfs that of any other country, accounting for approximately 40 percent of the world total.
- India also produces a ton and still has a huge amount of growth possible still, especially with new biotech improvements.

**China**

- Produces a ton but is becoming much more isolationist
- 99.5% of total cultivated area has been used for cotton plantation
- 33%: China percent of global **mill** use
- Joined WTO in 2001

"Since China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, textile manufacturing has been a core component of its economic development. Beginning in MY 2010, the Chinese government built strategic stockpiles of cotton to protect its textile industry. This, among other policies, generated a massive demand for foreign cotton, and China became the world's dominant cotton importer. However, China began to phase out these measures in MY 2014 and sell off its stockpile, bringing import levels in line with other countries."

**US**

Since MY 2015, seed genetic improvements and favorable cotton prices compared with other field crops provided a modest rebound in the U.S. crop.

Export fiber, import textiles

**Brazil**

Brazil—the fourth-largest cotton producer—experienced a record crop in MY 2019—as cotton there is now produced mainly as a second crop.

"In Brazil, cotton is grown in part as a second crop in rotation with soybeans or maize, and output has recently grown strongly in the main growing areas, such as Mato Grosso. Favourable growing conditions and a high rate of adoption of modern technologies have contributed to rising cotton yields and areas over recent years. These factors should support further strong production growth of 6% p.a."

Sustainability: Share of cotton lint produced under **sustainability or organic standards** has increased steadily

- Sustainable: 25% globally, 80% in Brazil
  - **Better Cotton Initiative**: 45%
  - **Responsible Brazilian Cotton**: 35%

## Supply

[Cotton Inputs](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-shares-of-energy-inputs-for-cotton-production_fig1_256091126)

- 30% Fertilizer
- 22% Diesel fuel
- 19% Machinery
- 11% Water

Seed --> Fibers --> Lint --> Textiles

Storage costs

**CROPGRO**-Cotton model: most popular cotton growth model

### Carryover Stocks

$\text{Stocks-to-Use Ratio =}$ $\frac{Begin \: + \: Production \: - \: Use}{Use}$

- Measure for S&D relationship
- Carryover stock as % of total demand
- Higher ratios = high supply = lower prices

### Production

#### Production Costs

Biotechnology innovations

- Due to genetic engineering, different varieties of cotton have been developed like Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton, which resulted in dramatic increase in cotton production.

Increasing farm mechanization

Cotton fiber substitutes:

- Polyester
- Other synthetics

#### Weather

"Cotton is grown in subtropical and seasonally dry tropical areas in both the northern and southern hemispheres, although most of the world’s production takes place north of the equator. The main producing countries are **India, China, the United States, Brazil, and Pakistan**. Together, these countries account for more than three-quarters of global production." (OECD)

**Phenology**: study of periodic events in biological life cycles and how these are influenced by seasonal and interannual variations in climate, as well as habitat factors.

- [**ENSO**](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/what-el-ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93southern-oscillation-enso-nutshell): ENSO is a single climate phenomenon with 3 phases (El Niño, La Niña, Neutral)

Cotton is fully mature and ready for harvesting approximately 160 days after being planted. Once the bolls have burst open, the farmers can prepare the cotton plants for harvesting. Boll opening should coincide with **less rainy season** to avoid seed and fiber quality deterioration from boll rot disease.

**Planting window**: may be from few days to weeks.

- **Soil temperature**: planting is not recommended if the soil temperature is below 16C (61F).
- Water availability
- Diseases, pests, and weeds
- Harvesting time of other crops in rotation with cotton

#### Land

How much cultivation area does the country have available? How much is used for cotton?

Crop alternatives:

- Corn
- Soybeans
- Wheat
- Regional crops—such as peanuts—can also be substituted for cotton.

**Production**: Cotton consumes more pesticide than any other crop; it is estimated that 25% of the worldwide use of insecticide and 10% of pesticide use are accounted for by cotton cultivation.

**Post-production**: Unlike agro, cotton needs special postharvest technologies. Some genetic approaches have also faced extreme debate in the last decades.

“White gold”: Especially important for **developing** countries to produce

## Demand

1 bale = 500 lbs

"International cotton prices are expected to remain elevated in 2022 supported by rising consumption and overall higher commodity prices but then to decrease in real terms throughout the outlook period. Global cotton demand remains under pressure from synthetic fibres, notably polyester.

From the early 1970s, when polyester became price-competitive, cotton prices tended to follow polyester prices. For example, cotton prices were only 5% above polyester staple fibre prices between 1972 and 2009. Since 2010, however, cotton prices have been on average almost 40% above the polyester price, in nominal terms. Over the past year, cotton prices have increased at a faster pace than those of polyester, resulting in a wider price differential. However, it is assumed that the relative competitiveness between these two types of fibre will not change drastically over the projection period."

## Uncertainties

*All from OECD*

Economic growth and urbanisation will continue to be the main factors affecting the per capita demand for cotton textiles in developing and emerging economies. Since the **consumption of textiles and apparel is more income responsive** than the consumption of food commodities, deviations from the economic conditions assumed for the developing world could lead to important changes in global cotton consumption, production, and trade projections.

Other demand trends could affect the projections. For example, **recycling by the textile industry** is creating a competitive secondary market that provides raw material to producers of lower-quality textiles and non-textile products. This trend could further reduce the demand for cotton and other fibres. On the other hand, greater adoption of sustainability standards in supply chains could provide additional stimulus to the demand for cotton.

Like other crops, cotton production is sensitive to **pests and weather conditions**. These projections are therefore sensitive to climate change, which could lead to increasing frequency of droughts and other adverse weather conditions. As noted above, yield growth has been slow in several countries over the past decade. Faster than expected improvements in **genetics and gene editing** (e.g. facilitated in part by a better understanding of the cotton genome) and better pest management have the potential to lead to higher yield growth than the projections in this *Outlook*. However, such innovations take time to develop and deploy, and in the case of genetically modified cotton are sometimes controversial. In **India, pink bollworm** has evolved resistance to Bt cotton, resulting in significant crop losses. In Burkina Faso, the introduction of Bt cotton in 2008 was effective in combatting bollworms but resulted in a shorter staple length (and hence lower quality premiums). This prompted the government to phase out Bt cotton in 2015.

Policies also play an important role in global cotton markets, notably stockholding measures. Other policy initiatives, such as support for domestic textile industries, input subsidies, may affect projections. Trade policies and tensions may also play a role in affecting the development of the raw cotton markets. In recent years, the **cotton market has been impacted by the US-China trade dispute**. In early 2021, the United States banned all products made in part or entirely from cotton produced in the Xinjiang region. Issues associated with social, economic, and environmental sustainability are becoming increasingly important for consumers, industry, and policy makers in many countries.

Policy measures that affect consumption include, for example, several **East African** countries that are increasingly **discouraging second-hand clothing imports**. This could bolster cotton consumption and encourage more added value in Africa. In **West Africa**, efforts from the government and the private sector are being made to **increase cotton processing capacities** across countries

## OECD Outlook

[Outlook for 2022-2031](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/eaea8c33-en.pdf?expires=1658677726&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=E6B41602A744B62E6A41B69118220F99)

High agriculture prices

- Covid: supply and trade disruptions, recovery in demand
- War: grains & oilseeds especially

Global food consumption

- 1.4% increase per year over the next decade
- Driven by population growth in low and middle-income countries
  - [Population growth graph](https://www.compareyourcountry.org/snaps/agricultural-outlook-2022/en/3607)

High income countries:

- **Population growth**: slow
- **Food**: stable demand overall, decline in sugar & animal protein.
- **Livestock**: Increase in demand due to rapid expansion & intensification in production

Low & middle income:

- **Population growth**: high, increasing food demand
- **Food**: increasing demand overall, increase in animal products, fats, staples
- **Livestock**: Improved feed efficiency, not as much feed needed
- **Production**: Expected increase, depends on production function & input prices

Production

- Yield growth is projected to account for 80% of global crop production growth, cropland expansion for 15%, and increasing cropping intensity for 5%.
- Cropland expansion is expected to be regionally concentrated in Asia, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa.
- Poultry is projected to account for more than half of the global growth in meat production due to sustained profitability and favourable meat-to-feed price ratios

### Cotton

World consumption of raw cotton is set to increase for the second consecutive year in 2021/22 (August/July) after the COVID-19 related downturn in 2019/20. Production is anticipated to recover after a drop in 2020/21. In 2021, higher prices of grains and oilseeds coupled with the recovery in global consumption triggered a strong increase in cotton prices, which averaged 40% higher than in 2020.

The distribution of cotton use across the globe depends on the location of cotton mills, which are often located in proximity to clothing and apparel industries.

China built up lots of mills, but has moved to other Asian countries, notably Viet Nam and Bangladesh.

Expansion of the harvested area will increase more in the United States and Brazil than compensating declines in China and Pakistan. Yields are improving due to genetics and better agricultural practices.

Global trade expected to increase 27% by 2031.

Uncertainties

- War
- COVID
- Interest rates
- Strong competition from synthetic fibres, notably polyester. Cotton is more sustainable though.
- Policy: Pests, climate change, trade

### Cotton | History

Mkt year  August - July

Cotton types

- Organic
- Pima
- Upland (80% of global production)

Crop alternatives:

- Corn
- Soybeans
- Wheat
- Regional crops—such as peanuts—can also be substituted for cotton.

Acreage changes from year to year are led by the largest four crops: corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton.

Potential exporters from the United States also face challenges related to a relatively strong U.S. dollar, which tends to keep U.S. commodity prices relatively high in foreign currency terms.

The decrease in the 8-crop area planted was driven primarily by a reduction in corn acres. However, shifts in prevented plantings acreage—which expanded by 4.3 million acres in 2022—were also influential. Acreage changes year-to-year are led by the largest four crops: corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton.

With the passage of the 2018 Bipartisan Budget Act, for example, seed cotton (unginned cotton) became a covered commodity under the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) and Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) programs. These programs continued with the passage of the 2018 Farm Act, the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (see [Farm Policy](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-commodity-policy/) for detailed information).

**CRP**: USDA Conservation Reserve Program

**2018 Farm Bill**: Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018

Ramp-up from 24.1M to 27M acres by 2026 more than offsets the moderate decline in the 8-crop total of planted acres during the projection period.

Growth in cotton production is driven by both yield and area gains.

Planted area is projected to steadily decline after 2023/24’s strong response to increased global demand and tight supplies.

From 21/22 --> 22/23, US production fell from 17,191 to 13,344 thousand bales. (-22.4%)

### Cotton | Projections

US accounts for ~15% of global production, is expected to remain the same through 2032.

The market year average prices for upland cotton start the projection period at 80 cents per pound, decline to 75 cents in 2025/26, and then rise to 82.5 cents per pound in nominal terms by 2032/33. The cotton price ratio is higher relative to corn and soybeans for 2023–32 compared with the previous 10 years.

World consumption of raw cotton is set to increase for the second consecutive year in 2021/22 (August/July) after the COVID-19 related downturn in 2019/20. Production is anticipated to recover after a drop in 2020/21. In 2021, higher prices of grains and oilseeds coupled with the recovery in global consumption triggered a strong increase in cotton prices, which averaged 40% higher than in 2020.

The distribution of cotton use across the globe depends on the location of cotton mills, which are often located in proximity to clothing and apparel industries.

China built up lots of mills, but has moved to other Asian countries, notably Viet Nam and Bangladesh.

Expansion of the harvested area will increase more in the United States and Brazil than compensating declines in China and Pakistan. Yields are improving due to genetics and better agricultural practices.

Global trade expected to increase 27% by 2031.
