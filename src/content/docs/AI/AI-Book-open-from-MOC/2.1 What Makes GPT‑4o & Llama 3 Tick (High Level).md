### Overview

```ad-sam
GPT‑4o (OpenAI) and LLaMA 3 (Meta) represent two of the most advanced LLMs currently available. 
Both models follow the **transformer** architecture but differ in design philosophy, training data, and usage priorities.

- **GPT‑4o** is optimized for commercial-scale AI applications with cutting-edge multimodal reasoning
- **LLaMA 3** is designed for flexible research & local deployment. 

```


```ad-sam
Distinct approaches in openness, specialization, and end-use design.

| FEATURE | Developer | Multimodal | Open Source          | Max Model Size | Inference           | Fine-tuning         | Use Cases                |
| ------- | --------- | ---------- | -------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| GPT‑4o  | OpenAI    | Yes        | No                   | Not disclosed  | Cloud-first         | Proprietary methods | ChatGPT, Copilot         |
| LLAMA 3 | Meta      | No         | Yes (non-commercial) | 70B            | Local & Cloud-ready | LoRA / QLoRA (open) | Research, OSS assistants |


- **Multimodal** means the model can understand and generate _multiple types of input and output_, such as **text/image/audio**


```

---
### Same
```ad-sam
- **Transformer**: Both use the transformer decoder stack with self-attention and feedforward layers.
- **Pretraining Objective**: Trained using next-token prediction on massive datasets.
- **Tokenization**: Use byte pair encoding (BPE) or variants.
- **Inference Mode**: Both support autoregressive text generation, often used in chat-based applications.
```

### Differences
#### GPT‑4o
```ad-sam
- **Multimodal**: GPT‑4o is natively multimodal—trained to process text, audio, image, and video in a unified model.
- **Training Emphasis**: Heavy focus on aligning model outputs with human preferences via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).
- **Usage Context**: Best in class for general-purpose, multilingual, and reasoning-heavy tasks.
- **Deployment**: Used in OpenAI’s commercial products (ChatGPT, Copilot).
```

#### LLaMA 3
```ad-sam
- **Open-Weight**: LLaMA 3 is released under a non-commercial license, enabling researchers to experiment and deploy with fewer constraints.
- **Variants**: Released in sizes like 8B and 70B, with a focus on efficiency and open availability.
- **Training Data**: Trained on 15T+ tokens, including public web data (filtered), books, code, and academic sources.
- **Specialization**: Emphasizes interpretability and community fine-tuning via LoRA and QLoRA.
