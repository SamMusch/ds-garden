> Tracks parameters, code versions, metrics, and artifacts.


Concepts:
- **Runs**: Runs are executions of some piece of code (eg, a single `python train.py` execution). Records metadata and artifacts.
- **Experiments**: An experiment groups together runs for a specific task.
- **Tracing**: Each "trace" is data that's recorded for future review, debugging, or analysis.
