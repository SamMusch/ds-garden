## 3.4 Storage (vector DBs)

load --> split --> embed --> ***store***

**databases**: organized collections of data

- **Relational**: organize structured data into rows x columns. (MySQL)

- **NoSQL**: handle unstructured & semi-structured (MongoDB)

- **Graph**: query graph data (Neo4j)

- ***Vector*: handle high-d vectors**

    - efficiently store and retrieve vector data such as embeddings

    - index & store vector embeddings for semantic search & retrieval

    - also offer <abbr title="scalability, security, multi-tenancy, versioning, data management, query processing, interfaces">traditional features</abbr> of dbs

```tabs

tab: vector DBs
***vector* databases** | 6 categories:

- *Vector indexes*: focus on **indexing** and **search**. No <abbr title="scalability, security, multi-tenancy, versioning, data management, query processing, interfaces">traditional features</abbr>. (eg <abbr title="Facebook AI Similarity Search">FAISS</abbr>, <abbr title="Non-Metric Space Library">NMSLIB</abbr>, <abbr title="Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah">ANNOY</abbr>, <abbr title="Scalable Nearest Neighbors">ScaNN</abbr>)

- *Specialized vector DBs*: same as ^, plus <abbr title="scalability, security, multi-tenancy, versioning, data management, query processing, interfaces">traditional features</abbr>. (eg Pinecone, ChromaDB, Milvus, Qdrant, Weaviate, Vald, LanceDB, Vespa, Marqo.)

- *Search platforms*: built for full text search, have now added vector similarity search capabilities. (eg Solr, Elastic Search, Open Search, and Apache Lucene)

- *SQL databases*: added vector capability. (eg Azure SQL, Postgres SQL(pgvector), SingleStore, and CloudSQL)

- *NoSQL databases*: added vector capability. (eg MongoDB)

- *Graph databases*: have vector capability. (eg Neo4j)

tab: choice considerations

- *Accuracy vs. speed*

- *Flexibility vs. performance*: customizations add overhead

- *Local vs. cloud storage*: local (storage speed, access) **vs** cloud (security, redundancy, scalability)

- *Direct access vs. API*: need tight control via direct libraries? or are ease-of-use abstractions like APIs better?

- *Simplicity vs. advanced features*: how advanced do we need to be?

- *Cost*

```

popular providers:

- **<abbr title="Facebook AI Similarity Search">FAISS</abbr>**: light, works for many applications

- **ChromaDB**: user-friendly vector DB

- **Pinecone**: offers managed services & customization
