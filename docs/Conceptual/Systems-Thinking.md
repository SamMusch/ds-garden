### Systems-Thinking Model

| Layer                               | Guiding Question             |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Purpose**                         | Why does this system exist?  |
| **Functions / Capabilities**        | What does it do?             |
| **Mechanisms / Principles**         | How does it achieve that?    |
| **Architecture / Structure**        | How are parts organized?     |
| **Components / Implementations**    | What are the concrete parts? |

general to specific:
**1. `Purpose` → 2. `Functions` → 3. `Mechanisms` → 4. `Architecture` → 5. `Components`**

causal hierarchy:
**`Purpose` drives  `Functions` requires `Mechanisms` determines `Architecture` composes `Components`**
