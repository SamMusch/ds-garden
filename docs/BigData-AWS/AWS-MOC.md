### Background

AWS offers cloud-based products that can be provisioned quickly without the upfront fixed expense.

    *Cloud computing*: the on-demand delivery of resources through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing.

    Advantages of cloud:

    - Pay as you go

    - Cheaper due to economies of scale

    - Scale capacity quickly

    - Multiple regions

    Types of cloud computing

    1. **Cloud**: app deployed in cloud + all parts of the app run in the cloud

    2. **Private cloud (on-prem)**: deploy resources on-premises (using virtualization and resource management tools)

    3. **Hybrid**
